abstract = {There appears to be a general relationship between abundance and distribution that has two parts. First, within species, population density tends to be greatest in the center of the range and to decline gradually toward the boundaries. This pattern holds over a range of spatial scales from steep environmental gradients within local regions to the entire geographic range. Exceptions include: (1) abrupt changes in abundance that usually correspond to sharp, discontinuous changes in single environmental variables; and (2) multimodal patterns of abundance that are caused by environmental patchiness. The second general relationship is that among closely related, ecologically similar species spatial distribution is positively correlated with average abundance. Again this pattern holds over a variety of spatial scales from local regions to entire geographic ranges. These empirical patterns have already been reported in the literature, but their generality is demonstrated by analysis of additional data for diverse kinds of organisms. A single general theory accounts for these observations and follows logically from three assumptions. First, the abundance and distribution of each species are limited by the combination of physical and biotic environmental variables that determines the multidimensional niche. Second, spatial variation in these environmental variables is somewhat stochastic but autocorrelated, so that nearby sites tend to have more similar environmental conditions than more distant ones. Third, closely related, ecologically similar species differ in no more than a very few niche dimensions. A more formal model can be developed that predicts that under these assumptions the distribution of population density over space should approximate a normal probability density distribution. Most exceptions to this predicted pattern can be explained as cases in which assumptions of the model are clearly violated. This paper represents an example of a statistical approach that should be useful for investigating complex ecological systems comprised of many components, such as species of many individuals or communities of many species. The general relationships between abundance and distribution developed here eventually should contribute to our understanding of the biogeography, population genetics, and evolution of species as well as the ecological attributes of populations and communities.},

abstract = {The generalised assignment problem (GAP) is the problem of finding a minimum cost assignment of a set of jobs to a set of agents. Each job is assigned to exactly one agent. The total demands of all jobs assigned to any agent can not exceed the total resources available to that agent. A review of exact and heuristic methods is presented. A $\lambda$-generation mechanism is introduced. Different search strategies and parameter settings are investigated for the $\lambda$-generation descent, hybrid simulated annealing/tabu search and tabu search heuristic methods. The developed methods incorporate a number of features that have proven useful for obtaining optimal and near optimal solutions. The effectiveness of our approaches is established by comparing their performance in terms of solution quality and computional requirement to other specialized branch-and-bound tree search, simulated annealing and set partitioning heuristics on a set of standard problems from the literature. {\textcopyright} 1995 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Teleost fishes account for 96% of all fish species and exhibit a spectacular variety of body forms. Teleost lineages range from deep bodied to elongate (e.g., eels, needlefish), laterally compressed (e.g., ribbonfish) to globular (e.g., pufferfish), and include uniquely shaped lineages such as seahorses, flatfishes, and ocean sunfishes. Adaptive body shape convergence within fishes has long been hypothesized but the nature of the relationships between fish form and ecological and environmental variables remain largely unknown at the macroevolutionary scale. To facilitate the investigation of the interacting factors influencing teleost body shape evolution we measured eight functionally relevant linear traits on adult-sized specimens along with specimen mass. Linear measurements of standard length, maximum body depth, maximum fish width, lower jaw length, mouth width, head depth, minimum caudal peduncle depth, and minimum caudal peduncle width were taken in millimeters with calipers, or tape measures for oversized specimens. We measured these traits on a total of 16,523 specimens (1–3 specimens per species) at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and took approximately 7000 person hours of data collection to complete. The data went through a three-step error-checking process to clean and validate the data and then species averages were calculated. We present the complete specimen data set, which encompasses approximately one-fifth of extant teleost species diversity, spanning $\sim$90% of teleost families and $\sim$96% of orders. The species and family names are compatible with the taxonomy used by FishBase and the order information with the phylogenetically informed taxonomy of Betancur-R and colleagues published in 2014.

abstract = {Ocean warming is driving species poleward, causing a 'tropicalization' of temperate ecosystems around the world. Increasing abundances of tropical herbivores on temperate reefs could accelerate declines in habitat-forming seaweeds with devastating consequences for these important marine ecosystems. Here we document an expansion of rabbitfish (Siganus fuscescens), a tropical herbivore, on temperate reefs in Western Australia following a marine heatwave and demonstrate their impact on local kelp forests (Ecklonia radiata). Before the heatwave there were no rabbitfish and low rates of kelp herbivory but after the heatwave rabbitfish were common at most reefs and consumption of kelp was high. Herbivory increased 30-fold and kelp abundance decreased by 70% at reefs where rabbitfish had established. In contrast, where rabbitfish were absent, kelp abundance and herbivory did not change. Video-analysis confirmed that rabbitfish were the main consumers of kelp, followed by silver drummers (Kyphosus sydneyanus), a temperate herbivore. These results represent a likely indirect effect of the heatwave beyond its acute impacts, and they provide evidence that range-shifting tropical herbivores can contribute to declines in habitat-forming seaweeds within a few years of their establishment.},

abstract = {Aim: The variation in species composition among sites, or beta diversity, can be decomposed into replacement and richness difference. A debate is ongoing in the literature concerning the best ways of computing and interpreting these indices. This paper first reviews the historical development of the formulae for decomposing dissimilarities into replacement, richness difference and nestedness indices. These formulae are presented for species presence-absence and abundance using a unified algebraic framework. The indices decomposing beta play different roles in ecological analysis than do beta-diversity indices. Innovation: Replacement and richness difference indices can be interpreted and related to ecosystem processes. The pairwise index values can be summed across all pairs of sites; these sums form a valid decomposition of total beta diversity into total replacement and total richness difference components. Different communities and study areas can be compared: some may be dominated by replacement, others by richness/abundance difference processes. Within a region, differences among sites measured by these indices can then be analysed and interpreted using explanatory variables or experimental factors. The paper also shows that local contributions of replacement and richness difference to total beta diversity can be computed and mapped. A case study is presented involving fish communities along a river. Main conclusions: The different forms of indices are based upon the same functional numerators. These indices are complementary; they can help researchers understand different aspects of ecosystem functioning. The methods of analysis used in this paper apply to any of the indices recently proposed. Further work, based on ecological theory and numerical simulations, is required to clarify the precise meaning and domain of application of the different forms. The forms available for presence-absence and quantitative data are both useful because these different data types allow researchers to answer different types of ecological or biogeographic questions.},

abstract = {Fouling communities on artificial marine structures are generally different from benthic communities in natural rocky habitats. However, they may also differ among different types of artificial structures. Two artificial structures in direct contact with arriving vessels were compared: floating pontoons within recreational marinas, and sea-walls within commercial harbours. Natural rocky habitats were used as a reference, and the genus Eudendrium (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa) was chosen as a bioindicator. The assemblages were different among the three types of habitat studied, with different species characterising each habitat. The probability of finding an invasive Eudendrium species was significantly higher on pontoons. Diversity was the lowest on pontoons, but it was not significantly different between sea-walls and natural rocks. In general, a barrier to the spread of exotic species exists between harbours and natural rocky habitats. Floating pontoons seem to be a less suitable habitat for native fauna and a key element in marine biological invasions.},

abstract = {Climate change triggers poleward shifts in species distribution leading to changes in biogeography. In the marine environment, fish respond quickly to warming, causing community-wide reorganizations, which result in profound changes in ecosystem functioning. Functional biogeography provides a framework to address how ecosystem functioning may be affected by climate change over large spatial scales. However, there are few studies on functional biogeography in the marine environment, and none in the Arctic, where climate-driven changes are most rapid and extensive. We investigated the impact of climate warming on the functional biogeography of the Barents Sea, which is characterized by a sharp zoogeographic divide separating boreal from Arctic species. Our unique dataset covered 52 fish species, 15 functional traits, and 3,660 stations sampled during the recent warming period. We found that the functional traits characterizing Arctic fish communities, mainly composed of small-sized bottom-dwelling benthivores, are being rapidly replaced by traits of incoming boreal species, particularly the larger, longer lived, and more piscivorous species. The changes in functional traits detected in the Arctic can be predicted based on the characteristics of species expected to undergo quick poleward shifts in response to warming. These are the large, generalist, motile species, such as cod and haddock. We show how functional biogeography can provide important insights into the relationship between species composition, diversity, ecosystem functioning, and environmental drivers. This represents invaluable knowledge in a period when communities and ecosystems experience rapid climate-driven changes across biogeographical regions.},

There was a clear lunar pattern with peak oocyte hydration and presence of flowing milt (i.e., actively spawning fish) during the full moon. A full moon spawn may be advantageous to juveniles settling during the following new moon after a short pelagic larval duration previously determined to be approximately 14 d.

We use a 60-year ocean basin-wide data set comprising >148,000 samples to reveal huge differences in range changes associated with climate change across 35 plankton taxa. While the range of dinoflagellates and copepods tended to closely track the velocity of climate change (the rate of isotherm movement), the range of the diatoms moved much more slowly. Differences in range shifts were up to 900 km in a recent warming period, with average velocities of range movement between 7 km per decade northwards for taxa exhibiting niche plasticity and 99 km per decade for taxa exhibiting niche conservatism. The differing responses of taxa to global warming will cause spatial restructuring of the plankton ecosystem with likely consequences for grazing pressures on phytoplankton and hence for biogeochemical cycling, higher trophic levels and biodiversity.},

abstract = {Climate-driven changes in biotic interactions can profoundly alter ecological communities, particularly when they impact foundation species. In marine systems, changes in herbivory and the consequent loss of dominant habitat forming species can result in dramatic community phase shifts, such as from coral to macroalgal dominance when tropical fish herbivory decreases, and from algal forests to 'barrens' when temperate urchin grazing increases. Here, we propose a novel phase-shift away from macroalgal dominance caused by tropical herbivores extending their range into temperate regions. We argue that this phase shift is facilitated by poleward-flowing boundary currents that are creating ocean warming hotspots around the globe, enabling the range expansion of tropical species and increasing their grazing rates in temperate areas. Overgrazing of temperate macroalgae by tropical herbivorous fishes has already occurred in Japan and the Mediterranean. Emerging evidence suggests similar phenomena are occurring in other temperate regions, with increasing occurrence of tropical fishes on temperate reefs. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, major advances have clarified how ecological patterns inform theory, and how in turn theory informs applied ecology. Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reflect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biology, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual unification across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a fixed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on flows of energy and matter. These findings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) environmental changes in the 21st century.},

abstract = {Extreme climate events such as hurricanes can influence the movement and distribution of fish and other aquatic vertebrates. However, our understanding of the scale of movement responses and how they vary across taxa and ecosystems remains incomplete. In this study, we used acoustic telemetry data to investigate the movement patterns of common snook (Centropomus undecimalis) in the Florida Coastal Everglades during Hurricane Irma, which made landfall on the southwest Florida coast as a Category 3 storm on 10 September 2017 after passing in close proximity to our study site. We hypothesized that the hurricane resulted in shifts in distribution and that these movements may have been driven by environmental cues stemming from changes in barometric pressure associated with hurricane conditions, fluctuations in water levels (stage) characterizing altered riverine conditions, or a combination of both hurricane and riverine drivers. The data revealed large-scale movements of common snook in the time period surrounding hurricane passage, with 73% of fish detected moving from the upper river into downriver habitats, and some individuals potentially exiting the river. Furthermore, regression model selection indicated that these movements were correlated to both hurricane and riverine conditions, showing increased common snook movement at higher river stage and lower barometric pressure, and stage explaining a larger proportion of model deviance. Animal movement has widespread and diverse ecological implications, and by better understanding the factors that drive movement, we may anticipate how future extreme climate events could affect fish populations in impact-prone regions.},

Differences in beta diversity among different areas or groups of samples can be tested using this approach. The choice of transformation and dissimilarity measure has important consequences for interpreting results. For kelp holdfast assemblages from New Zealand, variation in species composition was greater in smaller holdfasts, while variation in relative abundances was greater in larger holdasts. Variation in community structure of Norwegian continental shelf macrobenthic fauna increased with increases in environmental heterogeneity, regardless of the measure used.

Management typically focuses on target populations but lacks effective tools to document or restrain overexploitation of marine ecosystems. Here, we present three indices and accompanying thresholds to detect and delineate ecosystem overfishing (EOF): the Fogarty, Friedland, and Ryther indices. These are based on widely available and readily interpreted catch and satellite data that link fisheries landings to primary production using known limits of trophic transfer efficiency. We propose theoretically and empirically based thresholds for each of those indices; with these criteria, several ecosystems are fished sustainably, but nearly 40 to 50% of tropical and temperate ecosystems exceed even extreme thresholds. Applying these criteria to global fisheries data results in strong evidence for two specific instances of EOF, increases in both pressure on tropical fish and a climate-mediated polar shift. Here, we show that these two patterns represent evidence for global EOF.},

Warming and acidification may alter the interaction chains in these communities from the bottom and top of the food web. Yet, the relative importance of these potentially complex interactions has not yet been quantified. Here, we examine the isolated and combined effects of warming, acidification, and reductions in phytoplankton and predator abundances in a series of factorial experiments. We find that warming directly impacts the top of the food web, but that the intermediate trophic groups are more strongly influenced by indirect effects mediated by altered top-down interactions. Direct manipulations of predator and phytoplankton abundance reveal similar strong top-down interactions following top predator decline. A meta-analysis of published experiments further supports the conclusion that warming has stronger direct impacts on the top and bottom of the food web rather than the intermediate trophic groups, with important differences between freshwater and marine plankton communities. Our results reveal that the trophic effect of warming cascading down from the top of the plankton food web is a powerful agent of global change.},

abstract = {We have little empirical evidence of how large-scale overlaps between large numbers of marine species may have altered in response to human impacts. Here, we synthesized all available distribution data (>1 million records) since 1992 for 61 species of the East Australian marine ecosystem, a global hot spot of ocean warming and continuing fisheries exploitation. Using a novel approach, we constructed networks of the annual changes in geographical overlaps between species. Using indices of changes in species overlap, we quantified changes in the ecosystem stability, species robustness, species sensitivity and structural keystone species. We then compared the species overlap indices with environmental and fisheries data to identify potential factors leading to the changes in distributional overlaps between species. We found that the structure of the ecosystem has changed with a decrease in asymmetrical geographical overlaps between species. This suggests that the ecosystem has become less stable and potentially more susceptible to environmental perturbations. Most species have shown a decrease in overlaps with other species. The greatest decrease in species overlap robustness and sensitivity to the loss of other species has occurred in the pelagic community. Some demersal species have become more robust and less sensitive. Pelagic structural keystone species, predominately the tunas and billfish, have been replaced by demersal fish species. The changes in species overlap were strongly correlated with regional oceanographic changes, in particular increasing ocean warming and the southward transport of warmer and saltier water with the East Australian Current, but less correlated with fisheries catch. Our study illustrates how large-scale multispecies distribution changes can help identify structural changes in marine ecosystems associated with climate change.},

abstract = {Although long‐term ecological stability is often discussed as a community attribute, it is typically investigated at the species level (e.g. density, biomass), or as a univariate metric (e.g. species diversity). To provide a more comprehensive assessment of long‐term community stability, we used a multivariate similarity approach that included all species and their relative abundances. We used data from 74 sites sampled annually from 2006 to 2017 to examine broad temporal and spatial patterns of change within rocky intertidal communities along the west coast of North America. We explored relationships between community change (inverse of stability) and the following potential drivers of change/stability: (a) marine heatwave events; (b) three attributes of biodiversity: richness, diversity and evenness and (c) presence of the mussel, Mytilus californianus , a dominant space holder and foundation species in this system. At a broad scale, we found an inverse relationship between community stability and elevated water temperatures. In addition, we found substantial differences in stability among regions, with lower stability in the south, which may provide a glimpse into the patterns expected with a changing climate. At the site level, community stability was linked to high species richness and, perhaps counterintuitively, to low evenness, which could be a consequence of the dominance of mussels in this system. Synthesis . Assessments of long‐term stability at the whole‐community level are rarely done but are key to a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of climate change. In communities structured around a spatially dominant species, long‐term stability can be linked to the stability of this ‘foundation species', as well as to traditional predictors, such as species richness.},

But recent studies are showing that the tropics are also changing. Several lines of evidence show that over the past few decades the tropical belt has expanded. This expansion has potentially important implications for subtropical societies and may lead to profound changes in the global climate system. Most importantly, poleward movement of large-scale atmospheric circulation systems, such as jet streams and storm tracks, could result in shifts in precipitation patterns affecting natural ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources. The implications of the expansion for stratospheric circulation and the distribution of ozone in the atmosphere are as yet poorly understood. The observed recent rate of expansion is greater than climate model projections of expansion over the twenty-first century, which suggests that there is still much to be learned about this aspect of global climate change. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

These changes are the sum of local colonisation and extinction events, or changes in the biomass and relative abundance of taxa within and among samples. We conducted a quantitative review of currently available methods for the analysis of multivariate datasets collected at temporal intervals. This review identified the need for the application of quantitative, hypothesis-based approaches to understand temporal change in community composition, particularly for small datasets with less than 15 temporal replicates. To address this gap, we: (1) conceptually present how temporal patterns in community dynamics can be framed as specific, testable hypotheses; (2) provide three fully-worked case-studies, complete with R code, demonstrating multivariate analysis methods for temporal hypothesis testing and pattern visualisation; and (3) present a road map for testing specific, quantitative hypotheses relating to the underlying mechanisms of temporal community dynamics.},

In this process, existing hard structures, such as sea walls and riprap revetments, are supplemented with habitat forming species, e.g., oysters and mangrove trees, to improve habitat quality and function. Shoreline restorations in Biscayne Bay, Florida, USA, often utilize red mangroves, Rhizophora mangle (Linneaus, 1753), in addition to riprap revetments, to help stabilize the shoreline. This riprap-mangrove habitat provides structure for marine organisms to utilize and is believed to improve shoreline habitats in areas previously cleared of mangroves. We examined whether habitat provisioning was similar between restored mangrove habitat with the inclusion of riprap boulders and natural mangrove shorelines. We compared fish assemblages between natural mangrove and riprap-mangrove habitats within two areas of northern Biscayne Bay. Fish community structure and certain benthic cover types varied between mangroves and riprap-mangrove habitats. Total fish abundance was greater in mangrove habitat, while taxonomic richness was highest in riprap-mangrove sites in the northern part of the bay. Our findings suggest that fish assemblages and community structure are different between these habitat types, although the geographic context may mediate the effect of habitat type. Therefore, it is likely that these restored mangroves provide different ecological services than unaltered mangrove shorelines.},

The reasons for the variation across estuaries are unknown, but are likely related to differences in estuary geomorphology and habitat availability (e.g., extent of deep rivers and canals) and differences in the proportions of behavior contingents (i.e., segments of the population that use divergent movement tactics) that place snook in different areas of the estuary during winter. Emerging awareness of the presence of behavior contingents, identification of overwintering sites, and improvements of abundance indices in remote nursery habitats should provide a better understanding of population resilience to disturbance events for snook. Given that changes in the frequency of short-lived, severe cold events are currently unknown, the findings and management actions described here for a tropical species living at the edge of its distribution should be useful to scientists forecasting the effects of climate change.},

abstract = {We present evidence of ecological character displacement among species of threespined sticklebacks that inhabit small lakes of coastal British Columbia. Geological data suggest that the populations resulted from multiple divergence and speciation events over the past 13,000 yr. In lakes with two species, one is invariably "limnetic" in morphology and habitat, and the other is "benthic." Other lakes contain a single form morphologically intermediate between sympatric species and exploiting both habitat's. Within solitary populations individuals exploit one habitat or the other according to their morphology, which underscores the divergent selection pressures operating on either side of the habitat boundary. Our results satisfy at least four of the six major criteria for demonstrating the occurrence of character displacement: (1) a statistical null model of no displacement is easily rejected; (2) variation between and within populations is genetically based; (3) differences in sympatry reflect evolutionary shifts, not merely the biased extinction of similar forms; and (4) morphology is closely linked to resource use. Minimal resource differences between one- and two-species lakes and the presence of competition between similar phenotypes are still to be established. Our data suggest that competition for food has played a critical role in the divergence between species. We consider the possibility that it also helped in species formation, which would expand its potential role in adaptive radiation.},

abstract = {Mangroves provide vital ecosystem services at the dynamic interface between land and oceans. Recent reports of mangrove mortality suggest that mangroves may be adversely affected by climate change. Here, we review historical mortality events from natural causes (all mortality other than deforestation, land use change and pollution) and provide a global assessment of mortality drivers. Since the 1960's approximately 36,000 ha of mangrove mortality has been reported (0.2% of total mangrove cover in 2011) in 47 peer reviewed articles. Due to the uneven global distribution of research effort, it is likely that mangrove mortality events go unreported in many countries. It is therefore difficult to assess temporal changes in mortality due to the small number of reports and increasing effort in observations in recent years. From the published literature, approximately 70% of reported mangrove loss from natural causes has occurred as a result of low frequency, high intensity weather events, such as tropical cyclones and climatic extremes. Globally, tropical cyclones have caused the greatest area of mangrove mortality, equivalent to 45% of the reported global mangrove mortality area from events over six decades. However, recent large-scale mortality events associated with climatic extremes in Australia account for 22% of all reported historical forest loss. These recent mortality events suggest the increasing importance of extreme climatic events, and highlight that mangroves may be important sentinels of global climate change. Increasing frequency, intensity and destructiveness of cyclones as well as climatic extremes, including low and high sea level events and heat waves, have the potential to directly influence mangrove mortality and recovery, particularly in mid latitudes.},

abstract = {Some dramatic consequences of climate change are caused by shifting species interactions and associated changes to trophic structure and energy flow. In coastal ecosystems, the relative abundance of feeding guilds indicates dominant energy sources sustaining food webs. Here, we use a space-for-time substitution to investigate potential climate change impacts on trophic structure and energy flow in reef fish communities. We investigated latitudinal and seasonal patterns in the biomass distribution of five trophic groups across subtropical to temperate latitudes (29 to 44°S) in eastern Australia. Along western boundary currents, temperatures are increasing up to three times faster than the global average, making them ideal for studying climate change impacts. Using 10 years of Reef Life Survey data, we investigated potential determinants of fish biomass and community composition with generalized additive mixed models. Biomass decreased towards higher latitudes, from 220 g/m2 in the subtropics to 13 g/m2 in the south. Dominant trophic group also changed latitudinally, with herbivores and omnivores dominating lower latitudes ($\sim$30°S), zooplanktivores at mid-latitudes ($\sim$35°S) and benthic invertivores at higher latitudes ($\sim$40°S). Biomass varied seasonally, with lower latitudes experiencing a 3.2-fold increase between spring and autumn, while variation at higher latitudes was 1.9-fold. We found strong evidence that factors linked to latitude and seasonality are important determinants in the distribution of fish trophic structure. As climate-driven species redistributions accelerate in the 21st century, expected poleward shifts in trophic structure include overall increases in fish biomass linked to enhanced herbivory at mid-latitudes and increased planktivory at higher latitudes.},

abstract = {Artificial reefs (ARs) have been used globally to increase fish stocks, especially for local fisheries, but few studies have addressed the seasonal changes in fish attracted to ARs over extended periods. Bottom gillnets were used twice a year (wet versus dry seasons) to investigate how the composition and structure of fishing resources change over seasons during 20 years in the oldest experimental AR complex deployed in Southeastern Brazil. In total, 74 fish species were caught, and Sciaenidae, Carangidae and Ariidae families were the most representative in both numbers and occurrence. Fish abundance, species richness and biomass varied significantly between AR and reference site (RS), with higher values being recorded in the artificial habitats. Generalized additive models and ANOVA showed a gradual transition over time for the fish assemblages associated with the reef complex, indicating an initial phase primarily dominated by estuarine species, followed by an extended period of attraction by reef-associated fish and many species of commercial interest. The season was identified as the most important factor for the development of fish assemblages in the AR complex. Fish abundance increased gradually towards the 14th year after AR deployment and became more variable thereafter, with the stabilization or a abundance decreasing for some species. Our findings reveal that AR might be locally important for commercial species such as Rhizhoprionodon porosus, Macrodon ancylondon and Isopisthus parvipinnis, and highlight the importance of structurally complex structures as a promising strategy to enhance the attraction of fishery resources.},

abstract = {While considerable variation exists in ecological and economic impacts among nonindigenous species (NIS), the potential magnitude of cumulative impacts for each species increases with increasing area occupied. In the marine environment, large commercial ships have often transferred NIS across ocean basins to new continents. However, following such initial invasions, small craft (recreational and fishing boats) likely play an important role in the secondary, coastwise spread of NIS, thus increasing the geographic range and potential magnitude of impact. In this study, we assess the connectivity among bays in terms of small vessel movement and associated biofouling organisms in central California (USA), examining flux between a heavily invaded international port, San Francisco Bay (SFB), and three small marinas on the adjacent coast. We estimated vessel flux among locations, using data from 405 boater questionnaires and 4,000 transient boat records, and found a strong bi-directional connection between SFB and the nearby coastal marinas. Video surveys of 36 boats that had recently traveled revealed macrofauna on the underwater surfaces on 80% of boats, and at least 27 taxa (including 7 NIS) were present on boats sampled by SCUBA. Importantly, while we provide evidence for strong connectivity, our data most certainly underestimate the flux of vessels and cumulative transfers of organisms among these locations during this short-term study, as vessel movement data are incomplete and surveys are limited even in this small region. This study underscores the opportunities for biofouling organisms, many with limited self-dispersal capacity, to spread via small boats and suggests that effective management strategies to minimize NIS spread and impacts must address the small-boat vector.},

abstract = {The mechanisms initiating rapid, large-scale (>50 km2) seagrass die-off events globally remain elusive. Thalassia testudinum, a dominant habitat-forming tropical seagrass of the Caribbean and tropical Atlantic region, experiences recurrent die-off events in Florida Bay. Thus, T. testudinum provides an excellent case study to identify triggers of large-scale seagrass mortality. Presently, seagrass die-off events in Florida Bay are correlated to high total sulfide (H2S, HS−, S2−) concentrations in the sediment porewater (≥2000 $\mu$M), water column hypoxia, high temperature and hypersalinity (salinity > 45). Because the mortality appears to be initiated at the shoot base within the meristem, we examined the response of shoot meristematic O2 and H2S dynamics using microsensors over a 5-hour nighttime simulation. Shoots were held at salinity 35 (ambient) or 65 (hypersaline) using microsensors in intact cores with plants from the field. The rate of H2S intrusion in the dark and oxidation in the light were similar at 35 and 65 salinity. However, the tissue O2 consumption rate was significantly higher under hypersaline conditions (−11.07 ± 4.32 kPa pO2 h−1) compared to ambient (−3.93 ± 0.88 kPa pO2 h−1) in the dark. Consequently, the meristematic pO2 threshold ($\sim$1.5 kPa O2) where H2S intrusion occurred in the meristem was reached more rapidly, increasing the time H2S accumulated (1.5 to 2.8 h). Longer H2S accumulation time significantly increased maximum meristem H2S levels at 65 (536 ± 330 $\mu$M H2S) compared to 35 salinity (121 ± 62 $\mu$M H2S). These results in T. testudinum provide evidence for a triggering mechanism that links an enhanced respiratory rate under hypersaline conditions to sulfide toxicity. We propose that hypersalinity in Florida Bay, or any stressor that significantly increases nighttime respiration rates, can subject seagrasses to longer and higher concentrations of sulfide, a known phytotoxin, within the shoot meristem. This mechanism likely explains large-scale mass mortality of T. testudinum in Florida Bay during periods of high salinity and elevated porewater sulfide levels, although field experiments are required to further validate this supposition.},

abstract = {The relationships between biodiversity and stability were determined for both population and ecosystem traits in a long-term study of 207 grassland plots. Results demonstrate that biodiversity stabilizes community and ecosystem processes, but not pop-ulation processes. Specifically, year-to-year variability in total aboveground plant com-munity biomass was significantly lower in plots with greater plant species richness both for the entire 11-yr period and for the nine non-drought years. The change in total plant community biomass from before the drought to the peak of the drought was also highly dependent on species richness. For all three measures of total community biomass stability, multiple regressions that controlled for covariates showed similar significant relationships between plant diversity and stability. In contrast, year-to-year variability in species abundances was not stabilized by plant species richness for either all years or non-drought years. This difference between species vs. community biomass likely results from interspecific competition. When climatic vari-ations harm some species, unharmed competitors increase. Such compensatory increases stabilize total community biomass, but cause species abundances to be more variable. These results support both the predictions of Robert May concerning the effects of diversity on population stability and the diversity-stability hypothesis as applied to community and ecosystem processes, thus helping to reconcile a long-standing dispute.},

Individuals in the process of changing sex (transitional individuals), considered strongly indicative of protogyny, were observed. Functional protogynous hermaphroditism was confirmed for Epinephelus morio (Valenciennes, 1828) and Mycteroperca venenosa (Linnaeus, 1758), and for populations of Epinephelus guttatus (Linnaeus, 1758), Mycteroperca bonaci (Poey, 1860) and Mycteroperca tigris (Valenciennes, 1833) from the southern Gulf of Mexico. Although Mycteroperca microlepis (Goode & Bean, 1880) has been confirmed as pro-togynic in previous studies, distinctive transitional individuals were not identified in the analysed sample. Transitional individual rates were low in the studied sample: 1.0% for E. morio; 0.5% for E. guttatus and M. bonaci; 0.6% for M. tigris; and 0.2% for M. venenosa. Timing of sex change in these grouper species did not exhibit any seasonal pattern. For E. morio, M. bonaci and M. microlepis, the lack of primary males or bisexual individuals among juveniles collected from inshore waters, and the presence of morphological features characteristic of secondary males in testes from adults collected from offshore waters, suggest monandry in the southern Gulf of Mexico populations of these three species.},

Low-frequency modes of atmospheric variability for spring and autumn are demonstrated to account for a great deal of the seasonal asymmetry, with trends in spring circulation patterns exacerbating regional warming, and trends in autumn circulation patterns counteracting warming. After excluding warming associated with the primary modes of atmospheric variability, temperature trends in spring and autumn over western North America are similar to one another and in broad agreement with seasonal trends from a multimodel ensemble.

abstract = {We evaluated the potential contribution of allochthonous biomass subsidies to the upper trophic levels of offshore food webs in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (GOM). We made this evaluation considering nitrogen, an essential and often limiting nutrient in coastal ecosystems, to estimate the potential production of within-ecosystem biomass relative to the known import of biomass from an adjacent seagrass-dominated ecosystem. When adjusted for trophic transfer efficiency, we found the biomass subsidy from a single species (pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides) from nearshore seagrass habitat to the offshore GOM to be greater than the amount of nitrogen exported by two major rivers and local submarine ground water discharge. Our calculations show that seagrass-derived biomass accounts for approximately 25% of the total potential production in the northeastern GOM. This estimate is in agreement with a previous study that found 18.5-25% of the biomass in a predatory reef fish was derived from seagrass biomass inputs. These results indicate that all of the sources we consider account for the majority of the nitrogen available to the food web in the northeastern GOM. Our approach could be adapted to other coupled ecosystems to determine the relative importance of biomass subsidies to coastal ocean food webs. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {The snowshoe hare and the Canadian lynx in the boreal forests of North America show 9- to 11-year density cycles. These are generally assumed to be linked to each other because lynx are specialist predators on hares. Based on time series data for hare and lynx, we show that the dominant dimensional structure of the hare series appears to be three whereas that of the lynx is two. The three-dimensional structure of the hare time series is hypothesized to be due to a three-trophic level model in which the hare may be seen as simultaneously regulated from below and above. The plant species in the hare diet appear compensatory to one another, and the predator species may, likewise, be seen as an internally compensatory guild. The lynx time series are, in contrast, consistent with a model of donor control in which their populations are regulated from below by prey availability. Thus our analysis suggests that the classic view of a symmetric hare-lynx interaction is too simplistic. Specifically, we argue that the classic food chain structure is inappropriate: the hare is influenced by many predators other than the lynx, and the lynx is primarily influenced by the snowshoe hare.},

@article{Mumby2006,
abstract = {In 1983, the dominant urchin of Caribbean coral reefs (Diadema antillarum) experienced massive disease-induced mortality and its functional extinction persists to this day. Concurrently, reports of coral disease, coral bleaching and nutrification began to appear and many Caribbean reefs have deteriorated in the last two decades. Here, we describe a spatial simulation model of physical and ecological processes occurring on a dominant Caribbean for reef habitat, often referred to as Montastraea reef. The model uses a square lattice to simulate the dynamics of two types of hard coral (a brooder and spawner), cropped algal substrata and macroalgae. Grazing occurs independently by Diadema and parrotfishes and influences the competitive interactions between corals and macroalgae. Four important types of disturbance are simulated: loss of the urchin Diadema, hurricanes, fishing of parrotfishes and nutrification. We use the model to revisit the impact of losing the keystone herbivore, Diadema. The urchin imparted great resilience to Caribbean reefs in the face of severe disturbances including: high hurricane frequencies (once per decade), overfishing of scarids and a range of nutrification levels, including a doubling of the vertical growth rate, vegetative growth rate and colonisation rate of macroalgae. Parrotfishes are able to compensate for the loss of this urchin under a limited range of physical and ecological conditions. When not exploited, parrotfishes allow coral to persist at least at equilibrial levels when hurricane frequencies drop to around once every 20 years (e.g. those found in Central America). However, coral cover declined under decadal hurricane frequencies which may partly explain observations in regions of intense hurricane activity such as Florida. Parrotfish grazing is sufficiently intense to mitigate nutrification impacts providing that the cover of corals is not heavily depleted by other processes such as hurricanes and disease. Indeed, the cover of living coral exhibits a strong interaction with both grazing and nutrification in determining the survival of coral recruits. Reefs of higher coral cover have greater resilience for a given level of nutrification or grazing and therefore management efforts that arrest declines in coral cover will build greater natural resilience in the system. The model provides a strong case for conserving parrotfishes because reef decline is predicted to be inevitable when urchins are scarce and fishing of grazers is intense (e.g. to the levels seen in Jamaica). Lastly, the model provides a new perspective on the bottom-up versus top-down debate of macroalgal blooms in Jamaica. Nutrification impacts are predicted to be most important when urchins are scarce and parrotfishes are relatively lightly exploited. Therefore, a full understanding of the impact of nutrification will only occur if no-take marine reserves permit scarid biomass to reach unexploited levels. Under these conditions, coral cover is only predicted to increase if nutrification levels are low. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The dictionary definition of a law is: "Generalized formulation based on a series of events or processes observed to recur regularly under certain conditions; a widely observable tendency". I argue that ecology has numerous laws in this sense of the word, in the form of widespread, repeatable patterns in nature, but hardly any laws that are universally true. Typically, in other words, ecological patterns and the laws, rules and mechanisms that underpin them are contingent on the organisms involved, and their environment. This contingency is manageable at a relatively simple level of ecological organisation (for example the population dynamics of single and small numbers of species), and re-emerges also in a manageable form in large sets of species, over large spatial scales, or over long time periods, in the form of detail-free statistical patterns - recently called 'macroecology'. The contingency becomes overwhelmingly complicated at intermediate scales, characteristic of community ecology; where there are a large number of case histories, and very little other than weak, fuzzy generalisations. These arguments are illustrated by focusing on examples of typical studies in community ecology, and by way of contrast, on the macroecological relationship that emerges between local species richness and the size of the regional pool of species. The emergent pattern illustrated by local vs regional richness plots is extremely simple, despite the vast number of contingent processes and interactions involved in its generation. To discover general patterns, laws and rules in nature, ecology may need to pay less attention to the 'middle ground' of community ecology, relying less on reductionism and experimental manipulation. but increasing research efforts into macroecology.},

abstract = {Aim: Beta diversity (variation of the species composition of assemblages) may reflect two different phenomena, spatial species turnover and nestedness of assemblages, which result from two antithetic processes, namely species replacement and species loss, respectively. The aim of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the assessment of beta diversity, disentangling the contribution of spatial turnover and nestedness to beta-diversity patterns. Innovation: I derive an additive partitioning of beta diversity that provides the two separate components of spatial turnover and nestedness underlying the total amount of beta diversity. I propose two families of measures of beta diversity for pairwise and multiple-site situations. Each family comprises one measure accounting for all aspects of beta diversity, which is additively decomposed into two measures accounting for the pure spatial turnover and nestedness components, respectively. Finally, I provide a case study using European longhorn beetles to exemplify the relevance of disentangling spatial turnover and nestedness patterns. Main conclusion: Assigning the different beta-diversity patterns to their respective biological phenomena is essential for analysing the causality of the processes underlying biodiversity. Thus, the differentiation of the spatial turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity is crucial for our understanding of central biogeographic, ecological and conservation issues. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Substantial interannual variability in marine fish recruitment (i.e., the number of young fish entering a fishery each year) has been hypothesized to be related to whether the timing of fish spawning matches that of seasonal plankton blooms. Environmental processes that control the phenology of blooms, such as stratification, may differ from those that influence fish spawning, such as temperature-linked reproductive maturation. These different controlling mechanisms could cause the timing of these events to diverge under climate change with negative consequences for fisheries. We use an earth system model to examine the impact of a high-emissions, climate-warming scenario (RCP8.5) on the future spawning time of two classes of temperate, epipelagic fishes: “geographic spawners” whose spawning grounds are defined by fixed geographic features (e.g., rivers, estuaries, reefs) and “environmental spawners” whose spawning grounds move responding to variations in environmental properties, such as temperature. By the century's end, our results indicate that projections of increased stratification cause spring and summer phytoplankton blooms to start 16 days earlier on average (±0.05 days SE) at latitudes >40°N. The temperature-linked phenology of geographic spawners changes at a rate twice as fast as phytoplankton, causing these fishes to spawn before the bloom starts across >85% of this region. “Extreme events,” defined here as seasonal mismatches >30 days that could lead to fish recruitment failure, increase 10-fold for geographic spawners in many areas under the RCP8.5 scenario. Mismatches between environmental spawners and phytoplankton were smaller and less widespread, although sizable mismatches still emerged in some regions. This indicates that range shifts undertaken by environmental spawners may increase the resiliency of fishes to climate change impacts associated with phenological mismatches, potentially buffering against declines in larval fish survival, recruitment, and fisheries. Our model results are supported by empirical evidence from ecosystems with multidecadal observations of both fish and phytoplankton phenology.},

abstract = {Habitat reserves can promote ecological resilience to climate variability by supporting intact trophic webs and large-bodied individuals. Protection may also alter community responses to long-term climate change by offering habitat for range-shifting species. Here we analyse the species richness, diversity and functional traits of temperate reef fish communities over 20 years in a global warming hotspot and compare patterns in a marine reserve with nearby sites open to fishing. Species richness and diversity oscillated strongly on the decadal scale. Long-term warming signatures were also present as increasing functional trait richness and functional diversity, driven in part by a general increase in herbivores. Nevertheless, reserve sites were distinguished from fished sites by displaying: greater stability in some aspects of biodiversity; recovery of large-bodied temperate species; resistance to colonization by subtropical vagrants; and less pronounced increases in the community-averaged temperature affinity. We empirically demonstrate that protection from fishing has buffered fluctuations in biodiversity and provided resistance to the initial stages of tropicalization. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Climate change is promoting fast poleward expansion in many tropical marine fish species. With projected increases in sea surface temperatures, there is significant scope for increased range expansions in the future. However, the strength and consequences of density-driven competitive interactions between vagrant and resident fishes are largely unknown. Here, we investigate how the density effects resulting from the addition of tropical fishes to temperate assemblages may alter patterns of habitat and behaviour usage by both tropical vagrant and temperate resident species. We explore these impacts for two ecologically similar (diet, habitat and behaviour) pairs of vagrant and resident species (the territorial species Stegastes gascoynei and Parma microlepis, and the shoaling species Abudefduf vaigiensis and Atypichthys strigatus, respectively). We compare situations where the other member of each of these ecological pairs was present or absent. There was a shift in the type and structural complexity of habitat occupied, with all species displaying some characteristics of occupying seemingly less-preferred habitats in the presence of their pair species than without them. Behavioural effects were only apparent for the territorial species, which had altered feeding and vigilance patterns in the presence of their pair. These data indicate that the increased density of ecologically similar fish which results from the annual arrival of vagrant fishes is likely driving shifts away from optimal habitat usage and alterations in activity of both residents and vagrants, suggesting resource competition. The degree to which this competition was evident depended on the life history of the species, being stronger for the more territorial species. While similar research on additional species would be required to determine to what degree these results could be generalised to other territorial or shoaling species, this work suggests to highlight the important role that competition will play in determining both the ability of the vagrant species to become established within temperate communities, as well as the impact they may have once they have done so.},

abstract = {Several studies conducted at the scale of islands, or small sections of continental coastlines, have suggested that mangrove habitats serve to enhance fish abundances on coral reefs, mainly by providing nursery grounds for several ontogenetically-migrating species. However, evidence of such enhancement at a regional scale has not been reported, and recently, some researchers have questioned the mangrove-reef subsidy effect. In the present study, using two different regression approaches, we pursued two questions related to mangrove-reef connectivity at the Caribbean regional scale: (1) Are reef fish abundances limited by mangrove forest area?; and (2) Are mean reef fish abundances proportional to mangrove forest area after taking human population density and latitude into account? Specifically, we tested for Caribbean-wide mangrove forest area effects on the abundances of 12 reef fishes that have been previously characterized as "mangrove-dependent". Analyzed were data from an ongoing, long-term (20-year) citizen-scientist fish monitoring program; coastal human population censuses; and several wetland forest information sources. Quantile regression results supported the notion that mangrove forest area limits the abundance of eight of the 12 fishes examined. Linear mixed-effects regression results, which considered potential human (fishing and habitat degradation) and latitudinal influences, suggested that average reef fish densities of at least six of the 12 focal fishes were directly proportional to mangrove forest area. Recent work questioning the mangrove-reef fish subsidy effect likely reflects a failure to: (1) focus analyses on species that use mangroves as nurseries, (2) consider more than the mean fish abundance response to mangrove forest extent; and/or (3) quantitatively account for potentially confounding human impacts, such as fishing pressure and habitat degradation. Our study is the first to demonstrate at a large regional scale (i.e., the Wider Caribbean) that greater mangrove forest size generally functions to increase the densities on neighboring reefs of those fishes that use these shallow, vegetated habitats as nurseries.},

abstract = {Blooms of the harmful alga, Karenia brevis on the west Florida continental shelf are thought to initiate offshore before manifesting as a nuisance along the coastline. Contributing to such blooms are a complex sequence of events occurring within oligotrophic waters, which in any given year may or may not be facilitated by the ocean circulation. Once initiation occurs, the delivery from the region of offshore origination to the region of coastline manifestation requires an upwelling circulation, whereby K. brevis cells are advected shoreward along the bottom. The 2018 K. brevis bloom was particularly intense owing to cells from the preceding 2017 bloom being reinforced by a newly formed bloom in 2018, a year when the offshore conditions in spring through early summer were again favorable for bloom development. As an event response to determine the potential for new cells to be delivered to the shore, a glider was deployed from 24 August 2018 to 17 September 2018 with a track line designed to map water properties over the hypothesized initiation region. The coastal ocean circulation during the deployment interval was generally upwelling favorable, but the passage of Tropical Storm Gordon temporarily disrupted this flow, after which K. brevis appeared along the Florida Panhandle coast. Strong upwelling then reestablished and K. brevis was subsequently observed along Florida's east coast. We describe the glider deployment, the K. brevis observations, and we use a numerical circulation model to account for the K. brevis manifestation as occurred along Florida's west, Panhandle, and east coasts.},

abstract = {Over the past five years, two of the Slocum underwater gliders operated by the UK National Oceanography Centre have lost a wing mid-mission without the pilot being aware of the problem until the point of vehicle retrieval. In this study, the steady-state data collected by gliders during the two deployments has been analysed to develop a fault detection system. From the data analysis, it is clear that the loss of the wing was a sudden event for both gliders. The main changes to the system dynamics associated with the event are an increase in the positive buoyancy of the glider and the occurrence of a roll angle on the side of the lost wing, with significant difference between dives and climbs. Hence, a simple effective system for the detection of the wing loss has been designed using the roll angle. Since sensors are known to fail and the roll sensor is non-critical to the operation of the glider, a back-up diagnostics system has been developed based on the dynamic model of the vehicle, capturing the change in buoyancy. Both systems are able to correctly detect the loss of the wing and notify pilots, who can re-plan missions to safely recover the vehicle.},

abstract = {To assess the relationship among environmental stressors, seagrass susceptibility and Labyrinthula virulence, specimens of Thalassia testudinum were exposed to common abiotic stressors (hypersalinity, elevated temperature, nighttime hypoxia and elevated sulfide). Stressors were applied in isolation and in combination using an orthogonal design, incorporating either pulsed (Days 1-7) or sustained (Days 1-14) stress, with pathogen exposure occurring on Days 8-14. Seagrass infection responses were variable yet contingent upon environmental conditions affecting Labyrinthula viability. Following a 1 wk exposure period to any abiotic stressor (pre-infection), T. testudinum samples failed to show any significant drop in effective quantum yield. However, plant photochemistry declined significantly in response to successful infection, which was most prevalent under ambient conditions. Hypersalinity appeared to be the major factor which inhibited in vitro Labyrinthula sp. growth and in planta virulence. These data suggest that in the absence of selected abiotic stressors, Labyrinthula sp. has an enhanced capability of successful infection and can efficiently diminish host health (i.e. suppress photochemistry and lead to enhanced lesions). In summary, relatively short-term exposure to common environmental stres-sors has a generally negative influence on Labyrinthula sp. viability and virulence that can outweigh the effects of reduced T. testudinum photosynthetic health, essentially yielding an asymmetry favoring host defenses, but this asymmetry also reverses when stress is alleviated. When considering further the potential for complex interactions in this multi-stress system, positive antagonism may be more likely than synergistic or negatively antagonistic outcomes.},

However, their long-term population trends in areas with-out active management programs are unknown. Since 2005, we have monitored lionfish abundance in the Exuma Cays of the central Bahamas on 64 reefs ranging in size from 1 to 4000 m 2 . Lionfish densities increased from the first sighting in 2005 through 2009, leveled off between 2010 and 2011, and then began to decrease. By 2015, densities had noticeably declined on most of these reefs, despite a lack of culling or fishing efforts in this part of The Bahamas. There was no consistent change in lionfish size structure through time. We discuss possible causes of the decline, including reductions in larval supply or survival, hurricanes, interactions with native species, and intraspecific interactions. Further studies are required to determine whether the declines will persist. In the meantime, we recommend that managers continue efforts to control invasive lionfish abundances locally.},

abstract = {We show how directly transmitted microparasites, broadly defined to include viruses, bacteria, protozoans and fungi, may regulate natural populations of invertebrate hosts. The study combines elements of conventional epidemiology (where the host population is assumed constant) with elements of prey-predator studies (which conventionally emphasize how prey and predator populations may be regulated by their interaction). To this end, we construct simple models embodying the essentials of the dynamical interaction between invertebrate hosts and their directly transmitted microparasites. In successive refinements, these models include the effects of recovery and disease-induced mortality, castration or diminished reproduction of infected hosts, vertical transmission, latent periods of infection, stress-related pathogenicity, the interplay between disease and other density-dependent constraints on host population growth, and free-living infective stages. In analysing the dynamical behaviour of these models, we focus on : the possible regulation of the host population by the parasite; the basic reproductive rate of the parasite, and the way in which it affects the dynamics and the evolution of the host-parasite association; and the threshold host density and its implications for endemic or epidemic maintenance of the infection. These are examined in the light of synoptic compilations of field and laboratory data on: birth rates (and disease-induced reduction thereof), natural death rates and disease-induced death rates of hosts; latent periods and efficiencies of vertical transmission of pathogens; the rate of production and lifetime of free-living infective stages; and some characteristics of long-term cycles and of epidemic outbreaks of disease in forest insects. In particular, our models suggest that the baculovirus and microsporidian infections of many temperate forest insects will tend to produce stable cycles in host abundance and in prevalence of infection, with periods in the range 5-12 years. Enough is known about the European larch budmoth and an associated granulosis virus for us to undertake a detailed comparison between theory and data that strongly suggests that the observed 9-10 year cycles are driven by the host-parasite interaction. We also discuss the possible control of invertebrate pest species by pathogens, showing how our models could guide laboratory or field studies, to help estimate whether a given pathogen is capable of regulating the target pest population, and, if so, roughly what quantity is needed to effect a specific level of (local) control. Throughout, the emphasis is on the biological ingredients of the models, and on the biological conclusions to be drawn; mathematical details are given in appendixes.},

abstract = {Mangrove ecosystems have long been considered essential habitats and are commonly viewed and referred to as “nursery areas”. They are highly sensitive to climate change, and environmental transformations in these ecosystems are expected. The Sine Saloum estuary is a case of a system affected by global climate change where reduced precipitation and temperature increase have resulted in an inversion of the salinity gradient. Within the estuary, the composition and structure of the larval fish community related to environmental parameters were investigated using neuston and ring trawl nets. Larval fishes were sampled at 16 stations distributed along a salinity and distance-to-the-sea gradient during four field campaigns (November 2013, February, June, and August 2014) covering an annual cycle. This is the first study documenting the spatial and temporal assemblages of fish larvae in an inverse estuary. The total of 41 taxa representing 24 families and 34 genus identified in this study was lower than that of other tropical estuaries. Clupeidae spp. was the dominant taxon, accounting for 28.9% of the total number of fish larvae caught, followed by Gerreidae spp. (21.1%), Hyporamphus picarti (18.8%), Diplodus bellottii (8.9%), Hypleurochilus langi (4.8%), Mugilidae spp. (4.4%), and Gobiidae sp.1 (3.5%). A total of 20 taxa were recorded within the upper estuary region, whereas 29 and 37 taxa were observed in the middle and lower reaches, respectively. While larval fish were captured at all sites and during all seasons, abundances and richness decreased with increasing salinity. Larval fish assemblages also showed a clear vertical structure corresponding to three distinct water strata. Salinity, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen were the variables that best explained the spatial and temporal differences in larval fish assemblages. It is difficult to forecast the future situation for this system but so far, compared to other mangrove estuarine systems, we have observed the loss of freshwater species in favour of species of marine origin.

abstract = {It is a recognized principle of ecology that interactions of organismes and environment are reciprocal. The environment not only determines the conditions under which life exists, but the organisms influence the conditions prevailing in their environment. The examples on which this principle rests are usually difficult to describe in quantitative terms and are frequently local in their application. In the ocean the principal interactions between organisms and environment are chemical. Because of its unity, its fluid nature, and the intensity of the mixing to which the water is subject their nature, and the intensity of the mixing to which the water is subject their relations can be examined statistically and expressed in quantitative terms. The purpose of this essay is to discuss the relations between the statistical proportions in which certain elements enter into the biochemical cycle in the sea, and their relative availability in the water. These relations suggest not only that the nitrate present in sea water and the oxygen of the atmosphere have been produced in large part by organic activity, but also that their quantities are determined by the requirements of the biochemichal cycle. The argument is not simple and in order that it may be understood the nature of the biochemical cycle and the circulation of the elmeents involved are reviewed.},

abstract = {Estuaries are important nursery areas for fishes worldwide but large-scale studies of spatial patterns of use are lacking. This study presents data on larval fish diversity, abundance and distribution within and among a range of temperate estuary types, spanning 25 systems sampled from 1998 to 2008 in South Africa. A standardized boat-based plankton towing technique was used. Estuary type and physico-chemical conditions played a defining role in the trends observed. Estuary resident Clupeidae and Gobiidae dominated the mid-channel larval catch, particularly the preflexion stages in permanently and intermittently open estuaries and in estuarine lakes. Permanently open estuaries were also characterized by high numbers of larvae and early juveniles of marine migrant fishes. Density was higher in warmer months (spring and summer), which coincides with peak spawning in coastal habitats coupled with zooplankton maxima in the warm-temperate region. A strong seasonal component was also evident in larval fish catches in cool-temperate systems, but this peak coincided with late winter rainfall. River inflow provides a strong influence on food availability and larval survival. Species richness and diversity was higher in estuaries with either extensive habitat variability and/or a strong, natural good supply of river flow. This was particularly evident in the higher numbers of marine migrant larvae in these systems. Freshwater deprived estuaries also displayed high species diversity due to the higher incidence of marine straggler species. Characterization of salinity into zones provided a valuable means to understand distribution and abundance dynamics. Mesohaline zones had the highest density of larval fishes, providing ideal food patches. A select suite of species dominate the larval fish assemblages in the various estuary types studied. These patterns persist but species abundance and rank may vary interannually based on productivity and larval fish survival.},

abstract = {Globally, rising temperatures have resulted in numerous examples of poleward shifts in species distribution patterns with accompanying changes in community structure and ecosystem processes. In the Gulf of Mexico, higher mean temperatures and less frequent winter freezes have led to the expansion of tropics-associated marine organisms. Our objectives were to quantify changing environmental conditions and the poleward expansion of the common snook Centropomus undecimalis into the Cedar Keys area of Florida, USA (29 deg N). The snook is an economically and recreationally important sport fish found from southern Brazil to south Florida. Cedar Key and the Lower Suwannee River are north of the snook's historically documented range, likely due to lethal water temperatures during winter. Using data from a long-term monitoring program, we report an increase in catches of snook in this area since 2007. The spatial and temporal expansion of the species began with adult fish in 2007. By 2018, snook of all sizes were found in the region, and we found strong evidence of local reproduction during 2016-2018. The locations of nursery habitat and winter thermal refuges (e.g., freshwater springs) need to be identified and have implications for land-use policy and minimum-flow regulations for rivers. The arrival of the snook in the northern Gulf of Mexico could affect food web ecology and habitat interactions among estuarine predators, and future studies should evaluate snook's food habits and competitive interactions with resident fishes in this expanded range. Our study provides an example of how species range expansions due to changing temperatures should result in new research priorities to evaluate impacts of climate change on coastal systems.},

reproduction are known elsewhere in the invaded range, little is known
in the northern GOM {[}nGOM; Florida Keys (24.66(omicron)N) to south
Texas (26.00(omicron)N)]. In the present study, gonadosomatic index
(GSI) calculations were based on 4527 red lionfish Pterois volitans
(Linnaeus, 1758) specimens (April 2012 March 2015). Male and female GSI
peaked from May to October, corresponding with macroscopic gonadal
assessments of reproductively active females. Histological examination
of ovaries from 355 females found they were spawning capable during all
months. Males (n = 211) were spawning capable in all months except
March, the only month in which no actively spawning females were
present. A significantly higher percentage of reproductively active
females was found from May to December. Lionfish reached 50% maturity
at a small size (166.6 mm TL, females; 145.2 mm TL, males). Mean
relative batch fecundity (n = 71) was 92 eggs g(-1) gonad-free body
weight (GFBW) and was highest in August (207 eggs g(-1) GFBW). The
population spawning frequency was estimated to be every 2.5 d over 11 mo
in the nGOM, corresponding to a maximum potential annual output of
2,332,490 eggs for an average sized (188.6 g) female. These reproductive
characteristics are similar to invasive lionfish in tropical waters,
although nGOM reproductive output appears higher. Our results represent
the most comprehensive reproductive data on lionfish in their invaded

abstract = {In estuarine systems, proximity to the ocean has the potential to directly and indirectly drive patterns of fish distribution and population dynamics. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of fisheries-independent data and quantified patterns of density, biomass, and growth rates of juvenile Pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides) across spatial and temporal scales in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. Spatially, the highest density and biomass were found in the outermost regions (closest to the Gulf of Mexico) of the Bay, and these patterns were generally consistent temporally. Inter-annually, Pinfish density and biomass were the highest during periods coinciding with favorable oceanographic conditions (e.g., anomalously intense and prolonged upwelling) for across-shelf transport of larvae from spawning grounds in the Gulf to Tampa Bay. Intra-annually, density and biomass were the highest during spring and summer likely due to the combined effects of spawning timing (and delivery of new settlers), and high somatic growth fueled by increased secondary and primary productivity. Declines in density and biomass during the late summer through early winter were possibly due to high post-settlement mortality and egress to offshore habitats. Pinfish increased predictably in size across the months of the calendar year, and tended to be larger and grew faster in the innermost regions of the Bay, which were located farthest from the Gulf. Pinfish density was related to the proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, with the outermost regions of the Bay having greater seagrass cover, higher salinity, and being closer to the offshore larval pool where spawning occurs. Thus, this study provided evidence that distance to the ocean was an important driver of biotic and abiotic factors that influenced Pinfish demographic rates across spatial and temporal scales in the largest estuary in Florida.},

abstract = {Marine ecosystems worldwide experience rapid, persistent reorganization of biological and physical characteristics, known as ‘regime shifts.' Here we provide a multivariate analysis of the ichthyoplankton assemblage in southern California (USA) from 1951 to 2017 in both spring and summer. We found unequivocal support for compositional regime shifts in 1965 and 1976 across both seasons, and additional strong evidence for shifts in 1983 and 1990 in the spring assemblage. The 1965 regime shift was associated with increases from low to moderate abundance of several offshore taxa, as well as peaks in the abundance of Sebastes spp. The impacts of the 1976 regime shift have been widely documented elsewhere across the North Pacific; here we demonstrate that the 1976 regime shift in the southern Californian ichthyoplankton assemblage coincided with increases in a large group of taxa characteristic of southern and offshore environments. By contrast, shifts in 1983 and 1989 in the spring assemblage appear to have been driven by variations in just a few highly abundant taxa. Finally, despite speculation that there was a climate regime shift from a ‘warm' to a ‘cool' period in the late 1990s, we found no support for a shift in the larval fish assemblage during these years. Our analyses provide context for understanding the countervailing effects on fish of natural environmental variability from annual through multi-decadal scales, with important implications for how marine assemblages will respond to secular, global changes in climate.},

abstract = {Forage fishes play an important role in marine ecosystems by transferring energy and nutrients through the food web. The population dynamics of forage species can therefore have cascading effects across multiple trophic levels. Here, we analyzed a 19-year dataset on Pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides) across four eastern Gulf of Mexico estuaries to investigate population dynamics, inter- and intra-annual synchrony, metapopulation portfolio effects, growth, and habitat effects. Young-of-year growth rates did not differ among estuaries. The population dynamics of these four systems were stable in the long-term, but highly dynamic inter-annually. Intra-annual dynamics were stable and predictable despite variation in long-term means. Some estuaries exhibited positive inter-annual synchrony, and all four estuaries were synchronous intra-annually. There was evidence for stronger portfolio effects for the entire four-estuary metapopulation, as well as for the two northern estuaries while the southern estuaries appeared to act as a single population. Submerged aquatic vegetation was by far the most important predictor for both presence and abundance of Pinfish. It is important to understand the factors driving forage fish population fluctuations to better predict ecosystem effects, including those to species of economic and ecological importance. These predictors can be useful for the implementation of ecosystem-based management decisions.},

abstract = {The recently named Rice's whale in the Gulf of Mexico is one of the most endangered whales in the world, and improved knowledge of spatiotemporal occurrence patterns is needed to support their recovery and conservation. Passive acoustic monitoring methods for determining spatiotemporal occurrence patterns require identifying the species' call repertoire. Rice's whale call repertoire remains unvalidated though several potential call types have been identified. This study uses sonobuoys and passive acoustic tagging to validate the source of potential call types and to characterize Rice's whale calls. During concurrent visual and acoustic surveys, acoustic-directed approaches were conducted to obtain visual verifications of sources of localized sounds. Of 28 acoustic-directed approaches, 79% led to sightings of balaenopterid whales, of which 10 could be positively identified to species as Rice's whales. Long-moan calls, downsweep sequences, and tonal-sequences are attributed to Rice's whales based on these matches, while anthropogenic sources are ruled out. A potential new call type, the low-frequency downsweep sequence, is characterized from tagged Rice's whale recordings. The validation and characterization of the Rice's whale call repertoire provides foundational information needed to use passive acoustic monitoring for better understanding and conservation of these critically endangered whales.},

abstract = {The sea level history of the northernGulf ofMexico during recent geologic time has closely followed global eustatic sea level change. Regional effects due to tectonics and glacio-isostasy have been minimal. Over the past several million years the northernGulf coast, likemost stable coastal regions of the globe, has experienced major swings of sea level below and above present level, accompanied by major shifts in shoreline position. During advances of the northern hemisphere ice sheets, sea level dropped by more than 100 m, extending the shoreline in places more than 100kmonto the shelf. For much of the period since the last glacial maximum (LGM), 20,000 years ago, the region has seen rates of sea level rise far in excess of those experienced during the period represented by long-term tide gauges. The regional tide gauge record reveals that sea level has been rising at about 2 mm/year for the past century, while the average rate of rise since the LGM has been 6 mm/year, with some periods of abrupt rise exceeding 40 mm/year.During times of abrupt rise,Gulf of Mexico shorelines were drowned in place and overstepped. The relative stability of modern coastal systems is due primarily to stabilization of sea level approximately 6,000 years ago, resulting in the slow rates of rise experienced during historic time. Recent model projections of sea level rise over the next century and beyond may move northern Gulf coastal environments into a new equilibrium regime, more similar to that experienced during the deglaciation than that which has existed during historic time.},

Densities (numbers km-1 mangrove shoreline) were calculated using Jolly-Seber mark-recapture methods for mangrove-lined rivers and mangrove islands of the Ten Thousand Islands (TTI) and Everglades National Park, which includes Florida Bay, Florida, USA. Juveniles had smaller home ranges around islands (170 m) than in rivers (586 m), as determined from observations on telemetered fish. Goliath grouper remained in mangrove habitats for 5-6 yrs (validated ages from dorsal spine sections), then emigrated from mangroves at about 1.0 m total length. In the TTI, juvenile densities around mangrove islands were higher (mean = 25 km-1, SE = 6.2, CV = 0.5) and less variable than those in rivers (mean = 11 km-1, SE = 4.2, CV = 1.2). Density was negatively correlated with the frequency of dissolved oxygen and salinity minima. Mean growth rate of recaptured fish around mangrove islands (0.358 mm d-1, 95% CL = 0.317-0.398) was significantly higher than that in rivers (0.289 mm d-1, 95% CL = 0.269-0.308). The annual survival rate, as estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method on telemetered fish, was 0.947 (95% CL = 0.834-1.0). Very low densities in Florida Bay were probably related to other water-quality variables in this human-altered system. The offshore abundance of adults was largely explained by abundance of mangrove, but not seagrass habitat. Mangrove habitat with suitable water conditions, which appears essential to the recovery and sustainability of goliath-grouper populations, should be protected and/or restored. {\textcopyright} 2007 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.},

abstract = {Large changes in biodiversity are expected to occur if climate change continues at its current pace. Adverse effects include changes in species habitats and compositions, and consequently changes in ecosystem functioning. We assessed the magnitude of expected changes of biodiversity by performing a meta-analysis of the responses of species distributions to climate change. We focused on the proportion of local remaining species and their habitats. We summarized 97 studies and calculated two effect-size metrics from their results to quantify changes in biodiversity. These metrics are the fraction of remaining species (FRS) and the fraction of remaining area (FRA) with suitable climate for each species. Both metrics calculate deviations from the original biodiversity state and together they indicate biodiversity intactness. We found an expected gradual decrease in both FRS and FRA with significant reductions of 14% and 35% between 1 and 2 °C increase in global mean temperatures. Strong impacts are projected for both mammals and plants with FRS reductions of 19%. The climate-change response of biodiversity varies strongly among taxonomic groups and biomes. For some taxonomic groups the FRA declines strongly beyond 3 °C of temperature increase. Although these estimates are conservative, as we assume that species are unable to disperse or adapt, we conclude that already at moderate levels (i.e., 1–2 °C) of temperature increase a significant decrease of original biodiversity is projected. Our research supports the pledge to limit climate change to 1.5 °C and preferably lower to protect biodiversity.},

abstract = {The first recorded bloom of Karenia spp., resulting in brevetoxin in oysters, in the low salinity waters of the Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOMEX) occurred in November 1996. It raised questions about the salinity tolerance of Karenia spp., previously considered unlikely to occur at salinities <24 psu, and the likelihood that the bloom would reoccur in the NGOMEX. Salinity was investigated as a factor controlling Karenia spp. abundance in the field, using data from the NGOMEX 1996 bloom and Florida coastal waters from 1954 to 2004, and growth and toxin production in cultures of Karenia brevis (Davis) G. Hansen and Moestrup. During the NGOMEX bloom, Karenia spp. occurred much more frequently at low salinities than in Florida coastal waters over the last 50 years. The data suggest that the NGOMEX bloom started on the NW Florida Shelf, an area with a higher frequency of Karenia spp. at low salinities than the rest of Florida, and was transported by an unusual westward surface current caused by Tropical Storm Josephine. The minimum salinity at which growth occurred in culture ranged between 17.5 and 20 psu, but the optimal salinity ranged between low values of 20 or 25 and high values of 37.5-45 psu, depending on the clone. The effect of salinity on toxin production in one clone of K. brevis was complex, but at all salinities brevetoxin levels were highest during the stationary growth phase, suggesting that aging, high density blooms may pose the greatest public health threat. The results demonstrate that Karenia spp. can be a public health threat in low salinity areas, but the risk in the NGOMEX is relatively low. No bloom has occurred since the 1996 event, which was probably associated with a special set of conditions: a bloom along the Florida Panhandle and a tropical storm with a track that set up a westward current. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {To achieve a fully autonomous navigation for unmanned surface vessels (USVs), a robust control capability is essential. The control of USVs in complex maritime environments is rather challenging as numerous system uncertainties and environmental influences affect the control performance. This paper therefore investigates the trajectory tracking control problem for USVs with motion constraints and environmental disturbances. Two different controllers are proposed to achieve the task. The first approach is mainly based on the backstepping technique augmented by a virtual system to compensate for the disturbance and an auxiliary system to bound the input in the saturation limit. The second control scheme is mainly based on the normalisation technique, with which the bound of the input can be limited in the constraints by tuning the control parameters. The stability of the two control schemes is demonstrated by the Lyapunov theory. Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controllers. The introduced solutions enable USVs to follow complex trajectories in an adverse environment with varying ocean currents.},

abstract = {Invasive species possess unique traits that allow them to navigate the invasion process in order to establish and spread in new habitats. Successful hull fouling invaders must resist both physical and physiological stressors associated with their voyage. We characterised attachment strength and drag coefficient of common fouling species in order to estimate the velocity required to dislodge them from boat hulls. We hypothesized nonindigenous fouling species would possess biomechanical properties that enable them to remain attached to hulls more successfully than similar native species. Indeed, the well-known invasive ascidian Styela clava had both high attachment strength and low drag coefficient and its dislodgment velocity was well above that of fast moving vessels. In contrast, the native congener Styela gibbsii had low attachment strength and higher drag coefficient. Colonial invasive species employed a different hitchhiking strategy; despite their low attachment strengths, Botrylloides violaceus and Didemnum vexillum had low drag coefficients allowing them to be transported on slower-moving vessels, such as sailboats and barges. The biomechanical adaptations of invasive species show promise in predicting future invaders and informing vector management strategies at the first node in the invasion process: transport by the vector.},

abstract = {Coral reefs provide a number of ecosystem services including coastal defense from storms, the generation of building materials, and fisheries. It is increasingly clear that the management of reef resources requires an ecosystem approach in which extractive activities are weighed against the needs of the ecosystem and its functions rather than solely those of the fishery. Here, I use a spatially explicit simulation model of a Caribbean coral reef to examine the ecosystem requirements for grazing which is primarily conducted by parrotfishes (Scaridae). The model allows the impact of fishing grazers to be assessed in the wider context of other ecosystem processes including coral-algal competition, hurricanes, and mass extinction of the herbivorous urchin Diadema antillarum. Using a new analytical model of scarid grazing, it is estimated that parrotfishes can only maintain between 10% and 30% of a structurally complex forereef in a grazed state. Predictions from this grazing model were then incorporated into a broader simulation model of the ecosystem. Simulations predict that scarid grazing is unable to maintain high levels of coral cover (≥30%) when severe hurricanes occur on a decadal basis, such as occurs in parts of the northern Caribbean. However, reefs can withstand such intense disturbance when grazing is undertaken by both scarids and the urchin Diadema. Scarid grazing is predicted to allow recovery from hurricanes when their incidence falls to 20 years or less (e.g., most of Central and South America). Sensitivity analyses revealed that scarid grazing had the most acute impact on model behavior, and depletion led to the emergence of a stable, algal-dominated community state. Under conditions of heavy grazer depletion, coral cover was predicted to decline rapidly from an initial level of 30% to less than 1% within 40 years, even when hurricane frequency was low at 60 years. Depleted grazers caused a population bottleneck in juvenile corals in which algal overgrowth caused elevated levels of postsettlement mortality and resulted in a bimodal distribution of coral sizes. Several new hypotheses were generated including a region-wide change in the spatial heterogeneity of coral reefs following extinction of Diadema. The management of parrotfishes on Caribbean reefs is usually approached implicitly through no-take marine reserves. The model predicts that depletion of grazers in nonreserve areas can severely limit coral accretion. Other studies have shown that low coral accretion can reduce the structural complexity and therefore quality of the reef habitat for many organisms. A speculative yet rational inference from the model is that failure to manage scarid populations outside reserves will have a profoundly negative impact on the functioning of the reserve system and status of non-reserve reefs. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Using a complete randomized block design, we compared the effects of three hardwood reduction techniques (spring burning, application of the ULW{\textregistered} form of the herbicide hexazinone, chainsaw felling/girdling) and a no-treatment control on plant species richness, and on life form and common species densities at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, U.S.A., from 1995 to 1998. ULW{\textregistered} and felling/girdling plots were burned for fuel reduction two years after initial treatment application. We also sampled the same variables in frequently-burned reference sandhills to establish targets for restoration. Spring burns achieved partial topkill of oaks (17.6-41.1% from 1995 to 1998) compared to reductions of 69.1-94% accomplished by ULW{\textregistered} and of 93.2-67.8% by felling/girdling treatments. We predicted that plant species richnes and densities of herbaceous groundcover life forms would increase according to the percent hardwood reductions. Predictions were not supported by treatment effects for species richness because positive responses to fire best explained increases in plant richness, whereas ULW{\textregistered} effects accounted for the largest initial decreases. Legumes, non-legume forbs, and graminoids did not respond to treatments as predicted by the hypothesis. Again, positive responses to fire dominated the results, which was supported by greater herbaceous densities observed in reference plots. Overall, we found that the least effective and least expensive hardwood midstory reduction method, fire, resulted in the greatest groundcover improvements as measured by species richness and herbaceous groundcover plant densities.},

However, they lack a sufficiently urgent timeframe for initiating protection and a robust scientific method for the establishment of noteworthy Martian natural landmarks as natural reserves. In response, if we return to the seminal environmental preservation teachings of Aldo Leopold and John Muir, we encounter the importance of grounding Martian preservation efforts on the fundamental environmental science method of a base-datum of normality, or baseline ecology. This method establishes natural reserves that feature both minimal human interference and known origination dates, thereby providing longitudinal environmental control samples for scientific use. Applied before humans appear on Mars, preserved baseline ecologies thereby aid our scientific understanding of human environmental impacts, both now and well into the future, while they enhance a variety of other outcomes in terms of Martian protection. However, the baseline ecology method requires that, through international agreements, we establish these reserves as quickly as possible and certainly before humans arrive on the planet.},

abstract = {Marine invasive non-native species (NNS) are one of the greatest threats to global marine biodiversity, causing significant economic and social impacts. Marinas are increasingly recognised as key reservoirs for invasive NNS. They provide submersed artificial habitat that unintentionally supports the establishment of NNS introduced from visiting recreational vessels. While ballast water and shipping vectors have been well documented, the role of recreational vessels in spreading NNS has been relatively poorly studied. Identification of the main physical features found within marinas, which relate to the presence of NNS, is important to inform the development of effective biosecurity measures and prevent further spread. Towards this aim, physical features that could influence the presence of NNS were assessed for marinas throughout the UK in July 2013. Thirty-three marine and brackish NNS have been recorded in UK marinas, and of the 88 marinas studied in detail, 83 contained between 1 and 13 NNS. Significant differences in freshwater input, marina entrance width and seawall length were associated with the presence of NNS. Additionally, questionnaires were distributed to marina managers and recreational vessel owners to understand current biosecurity practices and attitudes to recreational vessel biosecurity. The main barriers to biosecurity compliance were cited as cost and time. Further work identifying easily distinguished features of marinas could be used as a proxy to assess risk of invasion.},

abstract = {Marine Autonomous Systems (MAS) operating at sea beyond visual line of sight need to be self-reliant, as any malfunction could lead to loss or pose a risk to other sea users. In the absence of fully automated on-board control and fault detection tools, MAS are piloted and monitored by experts, resulting in high operational costs and limiting the scale of observational fleets that can be deployed simultaneously. Hence, an effective anomaly detection system is fundamental to increase fleet capacity and reliability. In this study, an on-line, remote fault detection system is developed for underwater gliders. Two alternative methods are analysed using time series data: feedforward deep neural networks estimating the glider's vertical velocity and an autoencoder. The systems are trained using field data from four baseline deployments of Slocum gliders and tested on six deployments of vehicles suffering from adverse behaviour. The methods are able to successfully detect a range of anomalies in the near real time data streams, whilst being able to generalise to different glider configurations. The autoencoder's error in reconstructing the original signals is the clearest indicator of anomalies. Thus, the autoencoder is a prime candidate to be included into an all-encompassing condition monitoring system for MAS.},

abstract = {In The Origin of Species, Darwin proposed his principle of divergence of character (a process now termed "character displacement") to explain how new species arise and why they differ from each other phenotypically. Darwin maintained that the origin of species and the evolution of differences between them is ultimately caused by divergent selection acting to minimize competitive interactions between initially similar individuals, populations, and species. Here, we examine the empirical support for the various claims that constitute Darwin's principle, specifically that (1) competition promotes divergent trait evolution, (2) the strength of competitively mediated divergent selection increases with increasing phenotypic similarity between competitors, (3) divergence can occur within species, and (4) competitively mediated divergence can trigger speciation. We also explore aspects that Darwin failed to consider. In particular, we describe how (1) divergence can arise from selection acting to lessen reproductive interactions, (2) divergence is fueled by the intersection of character displacement and sexual selection, and (3) phenotypic plasticity may play a key role in promoting character displacement. Generally, character displacement is well supported empirically, and it remains a vital explanation for how new species arise and diversify.},

During the summer, low copepod biodiversity is accompanied by high biomass, with the opposite patterns prevailing in the winter. High biodiversity, and associated low biomass, is also observed during the summers of major El Ni{\~{n}}o events (1983, 1997-1998) and during years when the Pacific Decadal Oscillation is in a positive phase. From 1996 to the present, seasonally adjusted monthly anomalies of taxa richness and the Shannon-Weiner diversity index were compared to hydrographic and meteorological variables and to basin-wide climatological indices. Correlations of biodiversity with physical variables were strongest during the summer months for the Multivariate El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation Index, temperatures at a water depth of 50 m, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. During a 4-year cool period (1999-2002), biodiversity was low, likely a result of the increased transport of coastal subarctic waters into the northern California current. In recent years (2002-2005), however, there has been a dramatic increase in biodiversity. These increases may be attributable to the influence of a weak El Ni{\~{n}}o event in 2003; yet, high biodiversity persisted through the summer of 2005 and at times was higher than during the strongest El Ni{\~{n}}o events of the 20th century (1983 and 1997-1998). Our analyses suggest that changes in source waters, driven by remote basin scale forcing and not local environmental events, cause interannual-to-decadal variations in copepod biodiversity in the northern California current. {\textcopyright} 2006, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {The 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico began on April 20, originating in the deep sea 66 km off the Louisiana coast. By early June, DWH oil had spread to coastal Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and western Florida. An estimated 2,113 km of shoreline were oiled, making DWH the largest marine oil spill in global history by length of affected shoreline. Additionally, a series of oil spill response measures were deployed, including diversions of Mississippi River discharge to forestall oil coming ashore, and the establishment of large-scale fishery closures, with both affecting coastal resources to varying degrees. Here, we review published studies and describe additional analyses evaluating long-term impacts of DWH on coastal/nearshore biological resources. We assembled time-series data collected by state, federal and academic partners on population abundance and environmental conditions to evaluate species and community change. Our study focused on plankton, invertebrates, fishes and dolphins, and 13 “key species” were selected to conduct semi-quantitative vulnerability-resilience (V-R) analyses. At one extreme, early life stages of Gulf Menhaden (Brevoortia patronus) were not affected due to seasonal spawning and larval development preceding the spill. In contrast, demographically independent populations of the common Bottlenose Dolphin, (Tursiops truncatus) suffered a variety of severe and ongoing health effects owing to oil exposure. Virtually all of the heavily oiled salt marsh habitat was in Louisiana, with the majority occurring in Barataria Bay. Multispecies trawl survey abundances declined post-DWH throughout eastern coastal Louisiana but remained stable elsewhere. A regime shift in composition of Barataria Bay trawl survey catches occurred during and following the spill, the persistence of which was associated with long-term reductions in average salinity and increases in water clarity. In some cases, fishery closures were associated with measurable but ephemeral increases in abundance of some targeted and bycatch species. Freshwater flooding of marshes was ineffective in preventing coastal oiling and severely affected benthic euryhaline resources including Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and Marsh Periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata). The flooding response measure experiment also indicates the directionality of impacts that further planned water diversions may have on ecological communities of lower Mississippi River basins.},

abstract = {Antarctica's continental-scale ice sheets have evolved over the past 50 million years. However, the dearth of ice-proximal geological records limits our understanding of past East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) behaviour and thus our ability to evaluate its response to ongoing environmental change. The EAIS is marine-terminating and grounded below sea level within the Aurora subglacial basin, indicating that this catchment, which drains ice to the Sabrina Coast, may be sensitive to climate perturbations. Here we show, using marine geological and geophysical data from the continental shelf seaward of the Aurora subglacial basin, that marine-terminating glaciers existed at the Sabrina Coast by the early to middle Eocene epoch. This finding implies the existence of substantial ice volume in the Aurora subglacial basin before continental-scale ice sheets were established about 34 million years ago. Subsequently, ice advanced across and retreated from the Sabrina Coast continental shelf at least 11 times during the Oligocene and Miocene epochs. Tunnel valleys associated with half of these glaciations indicate that a surface-meltwater-rich sub-polar glacial system existed under climate conditions similar to those anticipated with continued anthropogenic warming. Cooling since the late Miocene resulted in an expanded polar EAIS and a limited glacial response to Pliocene warmth in the Aurora subglacial basin catchment. Geological records from the Sabrina Coast shelf indicate that, in addition to ocean temperature, atmospheric temperature and surface-derived meltwater influenced East Antarctic ice mass balance under warmer-than-present climate conditions. Our results imply a dynamic EAIS response with continued anthropogenic warming and suggest that the EAIS contribution to future global sea-level projections may be under-estimated.},

abstract = {A population of Encyclia tampensis was studied in a hammock near Fort Pierce, Florida, U.S.A. between November 1985 and January 1990. Nearly 100 orchids were recorded from a single live oak (Quercus virginiana) limb 2 m in length. Orchids ranged in size from 1 mm diameter protocorms to flowering plants with up to 30 pseudobulbs (3-20 mm in diameter). Recruitment occurred in three of the four years, resulting in a total of 36 protocorms. Most protocorms were short-lived (4.4 &#xb1; 0.8 months); however, four lived more than one year and the oldest lived for 17 months. "Protocorms" first appeared in early summer and died in fall and winter, apparently from desiccation. Older "prebulb" seedlings (&#x2248;2-5 years old) were the most numerous growth stage and lived longer than protocorms, with the majority surviving > 2 years (mean observed longevity = 21.5 &#xb1; 2.2 months). The longest-lived prebulb plant lived > 48 months. Mortality was lowest for plants with pseudobulbs (&#x2248; > 5 years); however, a few of these died. First flowering probably occurred at &#x2248;15 years of age. In December 1989, a severe cold front passed through Florida; temperatures reached&#x2014;5&#xb0;C, killing all the orchids. At other central Florida sites, mortality of E. tampensis was high (> 80%). Tillandsia spp., bromeliads (e. g., T. bartrami, T. fasciculata, T. flexuosa, and T. setacea) suffered variable mortality. Tillandsia rec&#xfa;rvala showed some mortality at exposed sites, but T. usneoides was unaffected. These observations suggest that meteorological factors (e. g., rainfall and low temperatures) can significantly affect epiphytes in Florida and must be considered in the context of conservation.

abstract = {A 1971 summer red tide (Gymnodinium breve Davis) and associated stress conditions resulted in mass mortalities and near extirpation of reef biotas from at least 1536 km2 of central West Florida Shelf. An estimated 77% of the resident fish species perished at shallow-water (12-1 8 m depths) reefs. Reef-fish colonization was monitored irregularly (1-6 month intervals) at two reefs for 3 years after the red tide. In addition, species censuses were taken 4 years after defaunation at one reef and 5 years later at both reefs. Since eastern Gulf of Mexico reefs occur as isolated patches, reef-fish coloniz- ation data were analysed in light of MacArthur and Wilson's species equilibrium model developed for insular biotas. Certain features of reef-fish colonization appeared consistent with the MacArthur-Wilson model: (1) an increasing convex colonization curve, (2) an observed immigration (colonization) rate de- creasing with time, (3) differences between colonization and decolonization (observed extinction) rate decreasing through time, and (4) attainment and maintenance of a rather stable species richness after 15 months colonization similar to the pre-defaunation level. However, other aspects of reef-fish coloniz- ation did not seemingly fulfil basic requirements of the model: (I) an erratic decolonization rate indicating no tendency to increase through time, (2) an observed species turnover rate considerably less than theoretical predictions, and (3) development of a compositionally stable community nearly identical with that existing prior to the red tide. It is proposed that eastern Gulf reef-fish communities develop according to well-defined successional rather than chance colonization processes. The eventual stability in species richness and composition probably represents attainment of a 'climax' community rather than a dynamic equilibrium resulting from continual species turnover. Possible reasons for failure of these communities to conform to the species equilibrium theory are presented. Introduction},

abstract = {Over the last half century, climate change, coral disease, and other anthropogenic disturbances have restructured coral-reef ecosystems on a global scale. The disproportionate loss of once-dominant, reef-building taxa has facilitated relative increases in the abundance of “weedy” or stress-tolerant coral species. Although the recent transformation of coral-reef assemblages is unprecedented on ecological timescales, determining whether modern coral reefs have truly reached a novel ecosystem state requires evaluating the dynamics of reef composition over much longer periods of time. Here, we provide a geologic perspective on the shifting composition of Florida's reefs by reconstructing the millennial-scale spatial and temporal variability in reef assemblages using 59 Holocene reef cores collected throughout the Florida Keys Reef Tract (FKRT). We then compare the relative abundances of reef-building species in the Holocene reef framework to data from contemporary reef surveys to determine how much Florida's modern reef assemblages have diverged from long-term baselines. We show that the composition of Florida's reefs was, until recently, remarkably stable over the last 8000 yr. The same corals that have dominated shallow-water reefs throughout the western Atlantic for hundreds of thousands of years, Acropora palmata, Orbicella spp., and other massive coral taxa, accounted for nearly 90% of Florida's Holocene reef framework. In contrast, the species that now have the highest relative abundances on the FKRT, primarily Porites astreoides and Siderastrea siderea, were rare in the reef framework, suggesting that recent shifts in species assemblages are unprecedented over millennial timescales. Although it may not be possible to return coral reefs to pre-Anthropocene states, our results suggest that coral-reef management focused on the conservation and restoration of the reef-building species of the past, will optimize efforts to preserve coral reefs, and the valuable ecosystem services they provide into the future.},

Small mammal communities remained remarkably stable, whereas birds declined markedly in response to warming and drying. Simulations of heat flux identified different exposure to warming for birds and mammals, which we attribute to microhabitat use.

abstract = {Under current levels of global warming most demersal species in the Northeast Atlantic are experiencing tropicalization, meridionalization or borealization of their distributions, leading to profound changes in demersal communities. We explore these changes using the Community Weighted Mean Temperature (CWMT), an index to link the thermal preference of demersal fish communities and temperature. The CWMT is calculated as the summation of the mean temperature of each fish species distribution weighted by its relative abundance in the community. The relative abundance is based on the community composition data obtained by the International Bottom Trawl Surveys (IBTS) in the Southern Bay of Biscay between 1983 and 2015. Our analyses show that the CWMT responds to the actual temperature of the water column reproducing its space–time trends in the study area: (i) an increase from SW to NE, towards the inner Bay of Biscay, (ii) a decrease with depth, except in the SW area characterized by an intense upwelling, (iii) a general increase along the time series. Applying a k-means classification to the CWMT data we identified warm-, temperate- and cold-communities over the shelf and slope and their spatial changes in the last decades. The area occupied by warm communities has expanded 268.4 km2/yr since the 80 s, while the cold communities have retracted at a speed of −155.4 km2/yr. The CWMT was able to capture the community dynamics in relation to environmental temperature at different temporal and spatial scales, highlighting the potential of this index to explore and anticipate the effects of climate change in demersal communities under different scenarios of global warming.},

Our research addresses the following three questions: (1) What is the relationship between winter climate and the presence and abundance of mangrove forests relative to salt marshes; (2) How vulnerable are salt marshes to winter climate change-induced mangrove forest range expansion; and (3) What is the potential future distribution and relative abundance of mangrove forests under alternative winter climate change scenarios? We developed simple winter climate-based models to predict mangrove forest distribution and relative abundance using observed winter temperature data (1970-2000) and mangrove forest and salt marsh habitat data. Our results identify winter climate thresholds for salt marsh-mangrove forest interactions and highlight coastal areas in the southeastern United States (e.g., Texas, Louisiana, and parts of Florida) where relatively small changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme winter events could cause relatively dramatic landscape-scale ecosystem structural and functional change in the form of poleward mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The ecological implications of these marsh-to-mangrove forest conversions are poorly understood, but would likely include changes for associated fish and wildlife populations and for the supply of some ecosystem goods and services. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Remote underwater video systems (RUVS) are increasingly used in scientific studies to monitor marine ecosystems. RUVS can be deployed baited (BRUVS) or unbaited (UBRUVS) and allow for an estimation of the MaxN metric, a relative measure of species abundance. Recording species MaxN in a variety of marine habitats provides associations between species abundance and habitat type, known as ‘species-habitat relationships'. However, the introduction of bait in BRUVS could obscure such relationships by inadvertently attracting fish from neighbouring habitats. Here, we investigate the species-habitat relationships of seven temperate marine species: Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), right-eyed flatfish (Pleuronectinae spp.), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), whiting (Merlangius merlangus), goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris), two-spotted goby (Gobiusculus flavescens) and shore crab (Carcinus maenas) as revealed by BRUVS and UBRUVS. Video systems were deployed in coastal areas in the Western Baltic, with a cobble coverage ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that all focal species responded to changes in cobble coverage, highlighting the importance of benthic habitat for a range of animals including benthopelagic species. Specifically, mean abundances of goldsinny wrasse and two-spotted goby were positively associated with cobble coverage, whilst right-eyed flatfish, herring, whiting and shore crab showed a negative association. Atlantic cod was found to be most abundant at intermediate cobble coverage between 65 and 70%, showing a unimodal trend with the mean abundance decreasing again at higher coverage. The relationships suggest that anthropogenic activities modifying benthic habitats, including extraction of material from the seabed and bottom trawling, likely change abundances of a range of marine species. Our comparative analysis suggests that both BRUVS and UBRUVS can identify previously documented species-habitat relationships. However, BRUVS demonstrated some superiority by confirming documented relationships for Atlantic cod and whiting, whilst UBRUVS failed to record any patterns for those species. Our data highlight the ability of BRUVS to identify changes in abundance across different habitats for a variety of species. Although the bait plume serves to attract organisms to the field of view, current results suggest that the use of BRUVS does not obscure species-habitat relationships in patchy coastal habitats. Therefore, future studies examining the importance of different marine areas may benefit from using BRUVS to quantify relationships between habitat variables and species abundance. Developing a better understanding of such relationships will be crucial in ensuring adequate management and protection of ecologically important marine habitats.},

Unfortunately, efforts to assess progress, as well as to strategically plan and prioritize new marine conservation measures, have been hampered by the lack of a detailed, comprehensive biogeographic system to classify the oceans. Here we report on a new global system for coastal and shelf areas: the Marine Ecoregions of the World, or MEOW, a nested system of 12 realms, 62 provinces, and 232 ecoregions. This system provides considerably better spatial resolution than earlier global systems, yet it preserves many common elements and can be cross-referenced to many regional biogeographic classifications.

abstract = {History has profoundly affected the composition, distribution, and abundances of species in contemporary ecosystems. A full understanding of how ecosystems work and change must therefore take history into account. We offer four well-studied examples illustrating how a knowledge of history has strengthened interpretations of modern systems: the development of molluscan antipredatory defenses in relation to shell-breaking predators; the North Pacific kelp ecosystem with sea otters, smaller predators, sea urchins, and large herbivores; estuarine ecosystems affected by the decline in oysters and other suspension feeders; and the legacy of extinct large herbivores and frugivores in tropical American forests. Many current ecological problems would greatly benefit from a historical perspective. We highlight four of these: soil depletion and tree stunting in forests related to the disappearance of large consumers; the spread of anoxic dead zones in the ocean, which we argue could be mitigated by restoring predator and suspension-feeding guilds; ocean acidification, which would be alleviated by more nutrient recycling by consumers in the aerobic ecosystem; and the relation between species diversity and keystone predators, a foundational concept that is complicated by simplified trophic relationships in modern ecosystems.},

abstract = {<p> Biofouling of experimental cages and other field apparatuses can be problematic for scientists and has traditionally been addressed using frequent manual removal (e.g., scraping, scrubbing). Recent environmental restrictions and legislative changes have driven the development of less hazardous antifouling products, making antifouling paint a potential alternative option to manual removal. Consequently, the viability of using these newly developed products as a replacement for the manual cleaning of exclusion cages was experimentally investigated. There were six treatments tested, comprising three with settlement tiles in experimental cages coated with antifouling paint, two with settlement tiles in unpainted experimental cages, and one cage-free suspended tile. The three antifouling treatments comprised two reduced-copper paints (21% Cu <sub>2</sub> O and 40% Cu <sub>2</sub> O) and one copper-free, Econea <bold> <sup>™</sup> - </bold> based paint (labeled “ecofriendly”). Antifouling paints were assessed for performance of preventing fouling of the cages and whether they elicited local effects on settlement tiles contained within them. All three paints performed well to reduce fouling of the cages during the initial six weeks of the experiment, but the efficacy of “ecofriendly” paint began to decrease during an extended deployment that lasted 14 weeks. The macro-community composition, biomass, and percent cover of settled organism on tiles within cages treated with copper-based paints (21% and 40% concentrations) were indistinguishable from tiles within the manually scrubbed cages. In contrast, settlement to tiles from the “ecofriendly” treatment was different in composition of macro-community and lower in biomass, suggesting the presence of local effects and therefore rendering it unsuitable for use in settlement experiments. The results of this study suggest that reduced-copper paints have the potential to serve as an alternative to manual maintenance, which may be useful for deployments in locations that are difficult to access on a frequent schedule. </p>},

abstract = {Observational records show that the area of ice caps on northern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada has diminished by more than 50% since 1958. Fifty 14C dates on dead vegetation emerging beneath receding ice margins document the persistence of some of these ice caps since at least 350 AD. In situ cosmogenic 14C in rock surfaces, and 14C in plant macrofossils from lake-sediment cores demonstrate that the plateau remained ice-free through the middle Holocene, but has supported ice caps for more than 2000 of the past 2800 years. The rapid disappearance of these ice caps over the past century, despite decreasing summer insolation, further demonstrates the unusual character of 20th Century warmth. Widespread ice-cap expansion ∼1280 AD early in the Little Ice Age, and intensified expansion ∼1450 AD, coincide with peak stratospheric volcanic aerosol loading and reduced solar luminosity, suggesting that these mechanisms may have initiated ice-cap growth, subsequently maintained by strong positive feedbacks.},

abstract = {Climate change pressures will influence marine planktonic systems globally, and it is conceivable that harmful algal blooms may increase in frequency and severity. These pressures will be manifest as alterations in temperature, stratification, light, ocean acidification, precipitation-induced nutrient inputs, and grazing, but absence of fundamental knowledge of the mechanisms driving harmful algal blooms frustrates most hope of forecasting their future prevalence. Summarized here is the consensus of a recent workshop held to address what currently is known and not known about the environmental conditions that favor initiation and maintenance of harmful algal blooms. There is expectation that harmful algal bloom (HAB) geographical domains should expand in some cases, as will seasonal windows of opportunity for harmful algal blooms at higher latitudes. Nonetheless there is only basic information to speculate upon which regions or habitats HAB species may be the most resilient or susceptible. Moreover, current research strategies are not well suited to inform these fundamental linkages. There is a critical absence of tenable hypotheses for how climate pressures mechanistically affect HAB species, and the lack of uniform experimental protocols limits the quantitative cross-investigation comparisons essential to advancement. A HAB "best practices" manual would help foster more uniform research strategies and protocols, and selection of a small target list of model HAB species or isolates for study would greatly promote the accumulation of knowledge. Despite the need to focus on keystone species, more studies need to address strain variability within species, their responses under multifactorial conditions, and the retrospective analyses of long-term plankton and cyst core data; research topics that are departures from the norm. Examples of some fundamental unknowns include how larger and more frequent extreme weather events may break down natural biogeographic barriers, how stratification may enhance or diminish HAB events, how trace nutrients (metals, vitamins) influence cell toxicity, and how grazing pressures may leverage, or mitigate HAB development. There is an absence of high quality time-series data in most regions currently experiencing HAB outbreaks, and little if any data from regions expected to develop HAB events in the future. A subset of observer sites is recommended to help develop stronger linkages among global, national, and regional climate change and HAB observation programs, providing fundamental datasets for investigating global changes in the prevalence of harmful algal blooms. Forecasting changes in HAB patterns over the next few decades will depend critically upon considering harmful algal blooms within the competitive context of plankton communities, and linking these insights to ecosystem, oceanographic and climate models. From a broader perspective, the nexus of HAB science and the social sciences of harmful algal blooms is inadequate and prevents quantitative assessment of impacts of future HAB changes on human well-being. These and other fundamental changes in HAB research will be necessary if HAB science is to obtain compelling evidence that climate change has caused alterations in HAB distributions, prevalence or character, and to develop the theoretical, experimental, and empirical evidence explaining the mechanisms underpinning these ecological shifts.},

abstract = {The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) ichthyoplankton surveys and systematic sampling of southern California power plant cooling-water intakes (PPI) provide independent, complementary time series to assess fish communities off southern California from nearshore to oceanic environments. The PPI program has sampled the shallow nearshore fish community at 5 sites along the coast of southern California since 1972, while CalCOFI has sampled fish larvae along 6 transects at standard stations ranging from 35 m depth to more than 500 km offshore since 1951. Recently published analyses of these data sets led us to examine potential relationships between them. Although there was limited overlap in the taxa sampled by the 2 programs, key multivariate patterns were highly correlated between them. Both time series exhibited dramatic declines from the 1970s to the 2000s: 78% for fishes entrapped by the power plants and 72% for the overall abundance of larval fishes in the CalCOFI time series. These trends, which predominantly affected taxa with cool-water affinities, were shared by fishes across nearshore and oceanic habitats, and included several trophic guilds and many unfished or only lightly fished taxa. These declines were significantly correlated with declining zooplankton displacement volumes across the California Current System (CCS), which suggests the influence of large-scale climatic and oceanographic drivers. Over the past 4 decades, changing environmental conditions appear to have produced more losers than winners in the CCS.},

abstract = {Mean global temperatures have risen this century, and further warming is predicted to continue for the next 50-100 years some migratory species can respond rapidly to yearly climate variation by altering the timing or destination of migration, but most wildlife is sedentary and so is incapable of such a rapid response. For these species, responses to the warming trend should be slower, reflected in poleward shifts of the range. Such changes in distribution would occur at the level of the population, stemming not from changes in the pattern of individuals' movements, but from changes in the ratios of extinctions to colonizations at the northern and southern boundaries of the range. A northward range shift therefore occurs when there is net extinction at the southern boundary or net colonization at the northern boundary. However, previous evidence has been limited to a single species or to only a portion of the species' range. Here we provide the first large-scale evidence of poleward shifts in entire species' ranges. In a sample of 35 non-migratory European butterflies, 63% have ranges that have shifted to the north by 35-240 km during this century, and only 3% have shifted to the south.},

abstract = {Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a 'systematic trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates 'very high confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

abstract = {Climate change is dramatically altering the distribution and abundance of many species. An examination of traits may elucidate why some species respond more strongly to climate change than others, particularly when ecophysiological thresholds set range limits. Mangrove forests are expanding polewards. Although multiple environmental factors influence mangrove distributions, freeze tolerance is hypothesized to determine their poleward extent. To investigate how trait variation influences mangroves' responses to a warming climate, we examined how freeze tolerance and associated traits varied along a latitudinal cline for three co-occurring mangrove species. We sampled individuals along >200 km of Florida, USA's eastern coast, from the mangroves' most northern populations, where freeze events were historically common, to southern populations where freeze events continue to be rare. We measured a suite of traits in field-collected adults and their garden-reared offspring, and assessed their responses to an experimentally imposed freeze event. We asked whether freeze tolerance and other traits varied predictably among species, with latitude, and between life stages. Species and populations varied dramatically in freeze tolerance, with the highest freeze tolerance in the northernmost species and populations, and the lowest freeze tolerance in the southernmost species and populations. Additionally, leaves of all three species were drier, tougher, thicker and more freeze-tolerant at the range edge. Tolerance to freezing appears to set the range limits for these mangrove species. All three species converged on a similar phenotype at the range edge, but species-level variation in freezing resistance was conserved. Thus, these species are likely to continue migrating at different rates in response to climate warming, potentially leading to the dissolution of typically co-occurring species and creating 'no analogue' coastal mangrove-marsh communities.},

abstract = {Freshwater inflow to estuaries delivers nutrients that drive primary production, but does inflow also affect secondary production? An ecological model was used to predict system-wide secondary production for two trophic groups of benthic organisms in response to different freshwater inflow regimes that result from the climatic ecotone along the Texas coast. The bioenergetic model was calibrated using an 11-year dataset (from 1988 to 1999) and validated with a 20-year data (from 1988 to 2008) from four estuaries in South Texas: Lavaca-Colorado (LC), Guadalupe (GE), Nueces (NE) and Laguna Madre Estuaries (LM). The estuaries lie in a climatic gradient where LC and GE receive more rainfall than NE, and NE receives more rainfall than LM. Consequently inflow and nutrient loading decreases and salinity increases along the gradient. In addition there is year-to-year variation in rain and inflow that results in wet and dry years. Therefore, this combination of the climatic gradient and temporal variability can be used to identify the effects of inflow variability on estuarine secondary production. Among Texas estuaries, increased salinity (and thus decreased inflow) benefited deposit feeders, while suspension feeders were reduced; thus there is a decrease in functional diversity when salinity is increased because of loss of a trophic guild. Within estuaries, the upstream benthic community is reduced by reduced inflow, whereas, the downstream community increases with reduced inflow and higher salinities. This is because lower salinity regimes are required to support food production for suspension feeders, and polyhaline deposit feeding species increase during marine conditions. This study demonstrates that freshwater inflow is important to maintain secondary productivity and functional diversity in estuaries, which is required to maintain estuarine health and sustainability. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Cancer is the most important cause of death for both men and women. The early detection of cancer can be helpful in curing the disease completely. So the requirement of techniques to detect the occurrence of cancer nodule in early stage is increasing. Earlier diagnosis of Lung Cancer saves enormous lives, failing which may lead to other severe problems causing sudden fatal end. Data mining is a powerful technique to help the people in their health, Scientific and Engineering. Those techniques are extracting the hidden information from the large databases which helps to find the relationships and patterns from the data. This proposal is used to develop a software based Self Organizing Map (SOM) structure which is used to discover the hidden patterns in the lung disorder CT images by using the data mining techniques. This approach starts by extracting the lung regions from the CT image using image processing techniques, including bit Image Slicing, Erosion and Weiner filtering. The bit plane slicing technique is used in the extraction process to convert the CT image into a binary image. Bit plane slicing technique is faster, data and user independent. So many algorithms were developed to detect lung cancer but they are not proved if the in dependent assumptions are taken into consideration. In the era of algorithms used for detecting lung cancer, a Software based SOM structure is not developed. This paper starts with visualizing the closed structure of the Lung regions and then the disorder dataset is process using SOM Toolbox to create a learned SOM using K-means clustering. By using this data mining technique with SOM, it has the advantages of robust to analysis and cost effective method. Data mining technique uses learning method to understand the data patterns. The SOM can be used within the data mining and exploratory data analysis process. {\textcopyright} Research India Publications.},

abstract = {Ocean temperatures have warmed in most regions over the last century and are expected to warm at a faster rate in the future. Consistent with the view that marine species are thermally constrained, there is growing evidence that many marine species have already undergone poleward range shifts in line with warming trends. This study uses historical observations of ocean temperature and climate model projections to examine the movement of isotherms that mark the boundaries for species' thermal habitats. In particular, we compare the rates of isotherm movement between different ocean regions and at different time scales and examine to what extent the implied movement is uniform or sporadic. Widespread long-term warming implies poleward shifts of isotherms in almost all regions. However, as the speed of isotherm movement is inversely related to local meridional SST gradients and the pattern of ocean warming is heterogeneous, speeds vary considerably between regions, season and over time. At present on decadal and longer timescales, changes due to low frequency natural SST variability can dominate over human-induced changes. As such, there are multidecadal periods in certain regions when we would expect to see range shifts that are much faster or in the opposite direction to that implied by a monotonic warming. Based on central estimates from the latest suite of climate model projections, median isotherm speeds will be about seven times faster in the 21st century compared to the 20th century under business as usual emissions. Moreover, SST warming is projected to be greater in summer than in winter in most oceanic regions, contrary to what is projected to occur over land. As such net poleward isotherm speeds, particularly in the northern hemisphere summer, are projected to be considerably faster than in winter. Finally we show that isotherms can exhibit erratic migration rates over time, even under uniform warming. Isotherm movement tends to stall at thermal fronts for extended periods of time and then rapidly shift to a new position, marked by more poleward fronts. This implies that species ranges would also be expected to undergo sudden rapid shifts rather than exhibiting a gradual monotonic poleward march.},

abstract = {Parasites comprise a substantial proportion of global biodiversity and exert important ecological influences on hosts, communities and ecosystems, but our knowledge of how parasite populations respond to human impacts is in its infancy. Here, we present the results of a natural experiment in which we used a system of highly successful marine protected areas and matched open-access areas in central Chile to assess the influence of fishing-driven biodiversity loss on parasites of exploited fish and invertebrate hosts. We measured the burden of gill parasites for two reef fishes (Cheilodactylus variegatus and Aplodactylus punctatus), trematode parasites for a keyhole limpet (Fissurella latimarginata), and pinnotherid pea crab parasites for a sea urchin (Loxechinus albus). We also measured host density for all four hosts. We found that nearly all parasite species exhibited substantially greater density (# parasites m-2) in protected than in open-access areas, but only one parasite species (a gill monogenean of C. variegatus) was more abundant within hosts collected from protected relative to open-access areas. These data indicate that fishing can drive declines in parasite abundance at the parasite population level by reducing the availability of habitat and resources for parasites, but less commonly affects the abundance of parasites at the infrapopulation level (within individual hosts). Considering the substantial ecological role that many parasites play in marine communities, fishing and other human impacts could exert cryptic but important effects on marine community structure and ecosystem functioning via reductions in parasite abundance. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {Background: The demand for fish and fish products is now higher than ever. However, several problems such as nutrient loading or excessive use of resources can be associated with the intensification of aquaculture systems. Integrated multitrophic aquaculture systems (IMTAs) refer to the co-culture of different species belonging to different trophic levels, and offer a sustainable approach to aquaculture development. In these systems, organic and inorganic extractive species will feed on other species waste or on uneaten feed nutrients, acting as bioremediators. Scope and approach: The extractive capacity that these organisms have to take up nutrients from the water also means they will accumulate chemicals that are often administered in intensive productions. The present review describes a vast number of substances that can be found in IMTAs, either intentionally administered or resulting from contamination, and subsequently accumulated in species reared afterwards in these systems. The presence of such chemicals in organisms produced in IMTAs raises several food safety and human health concerns, which need to be addressed. Key findings and conclusions: Although IMTAs still face many challenges in terms of large scale production, legislations are not yet ready to comprise co-cultivation of multiple species in proximity. Also, maximum residue limits already existent for fish must be set for other organisms also produced in IMTAs in order to protect consumer's health. An increase in extractive species consumption (e.g. seaweeds) has been noticed during the past few years, and as IMTAs gain importance as a sustainable production method, food safety issues must be tackled.},

We used 28 y of satellite imagery to demonstrate that the area of mangrove forests has doubled at the northern end of their historic range on the east coast of Florida. This expansion is associated with a reduction in the frequency of "extreme" cold events (days colder than ?4 °C), but uncorrelated with changes in mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and land use. Our analyses provide evidence for a threshold response, with declining frequency of severe cold winter events allowing for poleward expansion of mangroves.

Recent warming in the northeast Atlantic [4, 5] has caused distributional shifts in some fish species along latitudinal and depth gradients [6, 7], but such changes, as predicted by climate envelope models [8], may often be prevented because population movement requires availability of suitable habitat. We assessed the full impacts of warming on the commercially important European continental shelf fish assemblage using a data-driven Eulerian (grid-based) approach that accommodates spatial heterogeneity in ecological and environmental conditions. We analyzed local associations of species abundance and community diversity with climatic variables, assessing trends in 172 cells from records of >100 million individuals sampled over 1.2 million km 2 from 1980-2008. We demonstrate responses to warming in 72% of common species, with three times more species increasing in abundance than declining, and find these trends reflected in international commercial landings. Profound reorganization of the relative abundance of species in local communities occurred despite decadal stability in the presence-absence of species. Our analysis highlights the importance of focusing on changes in species abundance in established local communities to assess the full consequences of climate change for commercial fisheries and food security. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Many studies examine coral loss and its causes—and often presume a universal decline of ecosystem services with coral loss—rather than evaluating the range of possible outcomes for a diversity of ecosystem functions and services at reefs varying in coral cover. We evaluate 10 key ecosystem metrics, relating to a variety of different reef ecosystem functions and services, on 328 Caribbean reefs varying in coral cover. We focus on the range and variability of these metrics rather than on mean responses. In contrast to a prevailing paradigm, we document high variability for a variety of metrics, and for many the range of outcomes is not related to coral cover. We find numerous “bright spots,” where herbivorous fish biomass, density of large fishes, fishery value, and/or fish species richness are high, despite low coral cover. Although it remains critical to protect and restore corals, understanding variability in ecosystem metrics among low-coral reefs can facilitate the maintenance of reefs with sustained functions and services as we work to restore degraded systems. This framework can be applied to other ecosystems in the Anthropocene to better understand variance in ecosystem service outcomes and identify where and why bright spots exist.},

Snow acts as an insulator, and depth changes affect the enhancement of thermally dependent reactions, such as microbial activity, affecting soil nutrient composition, respiration, and winter gas efflux. Snow depth and spring temperatures influence snowmelt timing, determining the start of plant growth and forage availability. Delays in winter onset affect tundra carbon balance, faunal hibernation, and migration but are unlikely to lengthen the plant growing season. Mild periods in winter followed by a return to freezing have negative consequences for plants and invertebrates, and the resultant ice layers act as barriers to foraging, triggering starvation of herbivores and their predators. In summary, knock-on effects between seasons and trophic levels have important consequences for biological activity, diversity, and ecosystem function.},

Data trends show global climate change effects ranging from increased oxygen consumption rates in fishes, to changes in foraging and migrational patterns in polar seas, to fish community changes in bleached tropical coral reefs. Projections of future conditions portend further impacts on the distribution and abundance of fishes associated with relatively small temperature changes. Changing fish distributions and abundances will undoubtedly affect communities of humans who harvest these stocks. Coastal-based harvesters (subsistence, commercial, recreational) may be impacted (negatively or positively) by changes in fish stocks due to climate change. Furthermore, marine protected area boundaries, low-lying island countries dependent on coastal economies, and disease incidence (in aquatic organisms and humans) are also affected by a relatively small increase in temperature and sea level. Our interpretations of evidence include many uncertainties about the future of affected fish species and their harvesters. Therefore, there is a need to research the physiology and ecology of marine and estuarine fishes, particularly in the tropics where comparatively little research has been conducted. As a broader and deeper information base accumulates, researchers will be able to make more accurate predictions and forge relevant solutions. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

abstract = {Turnover in species composition between sites, or beta diversity, is a critical component of species diversity that is typically influenced by geography, environment, and biotic interactions. Quantifying turnover is particularly challenging, however, in multi-host, multi-parasite assemblages where undersampling is unavoidable, resulting in inflated estimates of turnover and uncertainty about its spatial scale. We developed and implemented a framework using null models to test for community turnover in avian haemosporidian communities of three sky islands in the southwestern United States. We screened 776 birds for haemosporidian parasites from three genera (Parahaemoproteus, Plasmodium, and Leucocytozoon) by amplifying and sequencing a mitochondrial DNA barcode. We detected infections in 280 birds (36.1%), sequenced 357 infections, and found a total of 99 parasite haplotypes. When compared to communities simulated from a regional pool, we observed more unique, single-mountain haplotypes and fewer haplotypes shared among three mountain ranges than expected, indicating that haemosporidian communities differ to some degree among adjacent mountain ranges. These results were robust even after pruning datasets to include only identical sets of host species, and they were consistent for two of the three haemosporidian genera. The two more distant mountain ranges were more similar to each other than the one located centrally, suggesting that the differences we detected were due to stochastic colonization–extirpation dynamics. These results demonstrate that avian haemosporidian communities of temperate-zone forests differ on relatively fine spatial scales between adjacent sky islands. Null models are essential tools for testing the spatial scale of turnover in complex, undersampled, and poorly known systems.},

abstract = {Stochastic factors affecting the demography of a single population are analyzed to determine the relative risks of extinction from demographic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity, and random catastrophes. Relative risks are assessed by comparing asymptotic scaling relationships describing how the average time to extinction, T, increases with the carrying capacity of a population, K, under each stochastic factor alone. Stochastic factors are added to a simple model of exponential growth up to K. A critical parameter affecting the extinction dynamics is $\tilde r,$ the long-run growth rate of a population below K, including stochastic factors. If r&#x303; is positive, with demographic stochasticity T increases asymptotically as a nearly exponential function of K, and with either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes T increases asymptotically as a power of K. If r&#x303; is negative, under any stochastic demographic factor, T increases asymptotically with the logarithm of K. Thus, for sufficiently large populations, the risk of extinction from demographic stochasticity is less important than that from either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes. The relative risks of extinction from environmental stochasticity and random catastrophes depend on the mean and environmental variance of population growth rate, and the magnitude and frequency of catastrophes. Contrary to previous assertions in the literature, a population of modest size subject to environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes can persist for a long time, if r&#x303; is substantially positive.},

abstract = {Seagrass habitats are a dominant component of coastal waters along the eastern Gulf of Mexico coast and are recognized as essential habitats for many species. Although various ecologically and economically important species depend on seagrass habitats at some life stages, these habitats are vulnerable to anthropogenic influences. As coastal human populations continue to grow, and nearshore habitats are affected, understanding the structure and function of assemblages associated with nearshore habitats is important for management and mitigation efforts. Therefore, we sampled estuarine and nearshore polyhaline seagrass beds monthly (May–November) from 2008 through 2015 using a 6.1-m otter trawl in seven estuaries in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Despite latitudinal variability, assemblage structure of fishes and selected larger invertebrates was predominantly driven by estuary morphology—semi-enclosed estuaries had significantly higher catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of estuarine obligates and incidental marine taxa, whereas open estuaries had higher CPUE of small forage and cryptic species. Furthermore, abundances of several important fishery species differed markedly between semi-enclosed and open systems. Our results highlight (1) the relative importance of different scales of environmental factors' influence on communities, (2) the need for understanding how seemingly similar habitats in estuaries of differing morphologies can support different fishery species, and (3) the importance of regional-scale monitoring data and its value in tracking ecological changes.},

In the marine rocky intertidal this requisite usually is space. Where predators capable of preventing monopolies are missing, or are experimentally removed, the systems become less diverse. On a local scale, no relationship between latitude (10⚬ to 49⚬ N.) and diversity was found. On a geographic scale, an increased stability of annual production may lead to an increased capacity for systems to support higher-level carnivores. Hence tropical, or other, ecosystems are more diverse, and are characterized by disproportionately more carnivores.},

abstract = {Quantifying changes in functional community structure driven by disturbance is critical to anticipate potential shifts in ecosystem functioning. However, how marine heatwaves (MHWs) affect the functional structure of temperate coral-dominated communities is poorly understood. Here, we used five long-term (> 10 years) records of Mediterranean coralligenous assemblages in a multi-taxa, trait-based analysis to investigate MHW-driven changes in functional structure. We show that, despite stability in functional richness (i.e. the range of species functional traits), MHW-impacted assemblages experienced long-term directional changes in functional identity (i.e. their dominant trait values). Declining traits included large sizes, long lifespans, arborescent morphologies, filter-feeding strategies or calcified skeletons. These traits, which were mostly supported by few sensitive and irreplaceable species from a single functional group (habitat-forming octocorals), disproportionally influence certain ecosystem functions (e.g. 3D-habitat provision). Hence, MHWs are leading to assemblages that are deficient in key functional traits, with likely consequences for the ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {It is well-known that climate change significantly impacts ecosystems (at the macro-level) and individual species (at the micro-level). Among the former, estuaries are the most vulnerable and affected ecosystems. However, despite the strong relations between climate change and estuaries, there is a gap in the literature regarding international studies across different regions investigating the impacts of climate change and variability on estuaries in different geographical zones. This paper addresses this need and reviews the impacts of climate change, variability and extreme weather on estuaries. It emphasises the following: (i) a set of climate parameters governing estuarine hydrology and processes; and (ii) a sample of countries in Asia (Bangladesh), Europe (Portugal) and South America (Uruguay). We reviewed the influences of the climatic drivers of the estuarine hydrology, ecological processes and specific species in estuarine communities across the selected geographical regions, along with an analysis of their long-term implications. The key results from the three estuaries are as following: (i) Hilsa fish, of which the catches contribute to 10% of the total earnings of the fishery sector (1% of GDP), are affected by climate-forced hydrological and productivity changes in the Meghna; (ii) extreme droughts and short-term severe precipitation have driven the long-term abundance and spatial distribution of both fish larvae and juveniles/adults in the Mondego; and (iii) the river inflow and fluctuations increases since the early 1970s have contributed to variations in the salinity, the stratification, the oxygen, nutrient and trophic levels and the spatial pattern for the life stages of planktonic species, fish biomass and captures in the Rio de la Plata. The results suggested that immediate action is needed to reduce the vulnerability of estuaries to climate stressors, mainly the changing river flows, storms and sea-level rise. As a contribution to addressing current problems, we described a set of adaptation strategies to foster climate resilience and adaptive capacity (e.g., early-warning systems, dam management to prevent overflows and adaptive fisheries management). The implications of this paper are two-fold. Firstly, it showcases a variety of problems that estuaries face from changing climate conditions. Secondly, the paper outlines the need for suitable adaptive management strategies to safeguard the integrity of such vital ecosystems.},

abstract = {Current predictions regarding the ecological consequences of climate change on animal populations are generally autecological and species-specific, and/or non-mechanistic extrapolations of recent short-term patterns. To better understand and predict the effects of climate change on the distribution of species and the abundance of populations we offer a novel, broad theoretical framework. Climate-induced changes in trophic structure may actually be more predictable than effects on individual species. The logic is that there are general differences in climatic sensitivity among trophic levels – specifically, that as one moves up trophic levels, there is an increase in the temperature sensitivity of vital rates. More precisely, we provide: (1) a formal mathematical definition of distribution limits that is both operational and conceptual, introducing the concept DL50, defined as the geographic and climatic isoline representing an equilibrium occupancy of half of the suitable habitats; (2) a matrix of the possible changes in trophic structure from climate change and the general theoretical consequences; and (3) a new idea that predicts broad effects of climatic warming on trophic systems. Our intention is to help meet the challenge of developing and testing general theoretical models that can predict which species will be winners and losers in ecological time, which evolutionary traits will be favoured or selected against, and what will be consequences for ecosystem structure and function.},

abstract = {Climate change-amplified temperature anomalies pose an imminent threat to coral reef ecosystems. While much focus has been placed on the effects of heat stress on scleractinian corals—including bleaching, mortality, and loss of reef structural complexity—and many studies have documented changes to reef fish communities arising indirectly from shifts in benthic composition, the direct impacts of heat stress on reef fish are much less well understood. Here, we quantify the direct and indirect effects of heat stress on reef fishes, using underwater visual censuses of coral reef fish communities conducted before, during, and after the 2015–2016 El Ni{\~{n}}o-induced global coral bleaching event. Surveys took place at the epicenter of this event, at 16 sites on Kiritimati (Republic of Kiribati; central equatorial Pacific) spanning across a gradient of local human disturbance. We expected that heat stress would have both direct and indirect negative effects on the reef fish community, with direct effects resulting from physiological stress during the event and indirect effects manifesting afterward as a consequence of coral mortality, and that the ability of fish communities to recover following the heat stress would depend on levels of local human disturbance. We found that total reef fish biomass and abundance declined by >50% during heat stress, likely as a result of vertical migration of fish to cooler waters. One year after the cessation of heat stress, however, total biomass, abundance, and species richness had recovered to, or even exceeded, pre-heat stress levels. However, the biomass of corallivores declined by over 70% following severe coral loss, and reefs exposed to higher levels of local human disturbance showed impaired recovery following the heat stress. These findings enhance understanding of the projected impacts of climate change-associated marine heatwaves on reef fishes, and highlight the interacting effects of local and global stressors on this vital component of coral reef ecosystems.},

Here, we evaluate sheepshead genetic variation—both mtDNA and microsatellite—in the domain of the two morphologically defined subspecies, Archosargus probatocephalus probatocephalus and Archosargus probatocephalus oviceps. Sheepshead were collected in coastal habitats of the southeastern United States, from North Carolina (Atlantic Ocean) to Texas (Gulf of Mexico). Significant variations in the mtDNA control region data indicated that the sheepshead is divided into two populations by a genetic break originating somewhere between Apalachicola (Florida gulf coast) and Indian River (Florida Atlantic coast), leaving a wide margin of uncertainty as to the exact area of the division. However, use of species-specific microsatellite markers revealed that the sheepshead is geographically structured by two genetic breaks into three population clusters. The first genetic break occurs at Apalachee Bay, close to the boundary between the two morphologically defined subspecies (i.e., between Apalachicola and Steinhatchee, on Florida's gulf coast). The second genetic break occurs off south Florida (Atlantic Ocean), where it coincided with a discontinuity of estuarine habitat between Miami and Palm Beach that likely impedes gene flow between populations. This second genetic boundary had been unrecognized for sheepshead, although it has been widely recognized as a genetic boundary for many other nearshore fish species in the southeastern United States},

abstract = {arbon nanotubes (CNTs) are not intrinsically superconducting but they can carry a supercurrent when connected to superconducting electrodes1, 2, 3, 4. This supercurrent is mainly transmitted by discrete entangled electron–hole states confined to the nanotube, called Andreev bound states (ABS). These states are a key concept in mesoscopic superconductivity as they provide a universal description of Josephson-like effects in quantum-coherent nanostructures (for example molecules, nanowires, magnetic or normal metallic layers) connected to superconducting leads5. We report here the first tunnelling spectroscopy of individually resolved ABS, in a nanotube–superconductor device. Analysing the evolution of the ABS spectrum with a gate voltage, we show that the ABS arise from the discrete electronic levels of the molecule and that they reveal detailed information about the energies of these levels, their relative spin orientation and the coupling to the leads. Such measurements hence constitute a powerful new spectroscopic technique capable of elucidating the electronic structure of CNT-based devices, including those with well-coupled leads. This is relevant for conventional applications (for example, superconducting or normal transistors, superconducting quantum interference devices3 (SQUIDs)) and quantum information processing (for example, entangled electron pair generation6, 7, ABS-based qubits8). Finally, our device is a new type of d.c.-measurable SQUID.},

abstract = {Novel ecosystems can differ from the native systems they replaced. We used phenology measures to compare ecosystem functioning between novel exotic-dominated and native-dominated grasslands in the central U.S. Phenology, or timing of biological events, is affected by climate and land use changes. We assessed how phenology shifts are being altered by exotic species dominance by comparing remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index within growing seasons at exotic- and native-dominated sites along a latitudinal gradient. Exotic species were dominated by the C3 species functional group in the north and the C4 species functional group in the south. Date of senescence was an average of 36 days later in exotic than native-dominated grasslands, and this effect was consistent across latitudes. Exotic-dominated grasslands greened-up an average of 10.7 days earlier than native-dominated grasslands, but this effect was highly dependent on latitude and the plant functional group that dominated at that latitude. Green-up differed between native and exotic sites the most in central and northern regions that had dominant C3 grasses. We estimated the effects of an increase in global temperatures on green-up and senescence with a space-for-time substitution, and by comparing growing degree day differences between historical average temperatures and +2.5°C. Green-up was significantly earlier and senescence was significantly later with a 2.5°C increase in temperature. The native–exotic difference was significantly greater than the difference due to increased temperature for senescence, but not for green-up. Synthesis and applications. Native to exotic plant conversions in central U.S. grasslands have led to highly altered phenology, especially in terms of senescence, and this effect should be considered along with global warming in models moving forward. This conversion will have to be considered in developing estimates of how global change will affect phenology in locations where exotics are present, especially in cases where their abundance is increasing concurrent with climate change. Global change models and policy should consider exotic species invasion as an additional widespread factor behind changes in phenology.},

Despite several important studies, Indigenous fisheries generally receive less attention from scholars and managers than the 17th–20th century capitalist commercial fisheries that decimated many keystone species, including oysters. We investigate Indigenous oyster harvest through time in North America and Australia, placing these data in the context of sea level histories and historical catch records. Indigenous oyster fisheries were pervasive across space and through time, persisting for 5000–10,000 years or more. Oysters were likely managed and sometimes “farmed,” and are woven into broader cultural, ritual, and social traditions. Effective stewardship of oyster reefs and other marine fisheries around the world must center Indigenous histories and include Indigenous community members to co-develop more inclusive, just, and successful strategies for restoration, harvest, and management.},

abstract = {Understanding the evolution of Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR), which has contradicting global and regional trends, is crucial because it influences environmental and human health. Here, we analyse the regional evolution of DTR trend over different climatic zones in India using a non-stationary approach known as the Multidimensional Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEEMD) method, to explore the generalized influence of regional climate on DTR, if any. We report a 0.36 °C increase in overall mean of DTR till 1980, however, the rate has declined since then. Further, arid deserts and warm-temperate grasslands exhibit negative DTR trends, while the west coast and sub-tropical forest in the north-east show positive trends. This transition predominantly begins with a 0.5 °C increase from the west coast and spreads with an increase of 0.25 °C per decade. These changes are more pronounced during winter and post-monsoon, especially in the arid desert and warm-temperate grasslands, the DTR decreased up to 2 °C, where the rate of increase in minimum temperature is higher than the maximum temperature. We conclude that both maximum and minimum temperature increase in response to the global climate change, however, their rates of increase are highly local and depend on the underlying climatic zone.},

abstract = {Ecosystems function in a series of feedback loops that can change or maintain vegetation structure. Vegetation structure influences the ecological niche space available to animals, shaping many aspects of behaviour and reproduction. In turn, animals perform ecological functions that shape vegetation structure. However, most studies concerning three-dimensional vegetation structure and animal ecology consider only a single direction of this relationship. Here, we review these separate lines of research and integrate them into a unified concept that describes a feedback mechanism. We also show how remote sensing and animal tracking technologies are now available at the global scale to describe feedback loops and their consequences for ecosystem functioning. An improved understanding of how animals interact with vegetation structure in feedback loops is needed to conserve ecosystems that face major disruptions in response to climate and land-use change.},

abstract = {Climate change is resulting in rapid poleward shifts in the geographical distribution of tropical and subtropical fish species. We can expect that such range shifts are likely to be limited by species-specific resource requirements, with temperate rocky reefs potentially lacking a range of settlement substrates or specific dietary components important in structuring the settlement and success of tropical and subtropical fish species. We examined the importance of resource use in structuring the distribution patterns of range shifting tropical and subtropical fishes, comparing this with resident temperate fish species within western Japan (Tosa Bay); the abundance, diversity, size class, functional structure and latitudinal range of reef fishes utilizing both coral reef and adjacent rocky reef habitat were quantified over a 2 year period (2008-2010). This region has undergone rapid poleward expansion of reef-building corals in response to increasing coastal water temperatures, and forms one of the global hotspots for rapid coastal changes. Despite the temperate latitude surveyed (33°N, 133°E) the fish assemblage was both numerically, and in terms of richness, dominated by tropical fishes. Such tropical faunal dominance was apparent within both coral, and rocky reef habitats. The size structure of the assemblage suggested that a relatively large number of tropical species are overwintering within both coral and rocky habitats, with a subset of these species being potentially reproductively active. The relatively high abundance and richness of tropical species with obligate associations with live coral resources (i.e., obligate corallivores) shows that this region holds the most well developed temperate-located tropical fish fauna globally. We argue that future tropicalisation of the fish fauna in western Japan, associated with increasing coral habitat development and reported increasing shifts in coastal water temperatures, may have considerable positive economic impacts to the local tourism industry and bring qualitative changes to both local and regional fisheries resources. {\textcopyright} 2013 Nakamura et al.},

abstract = {Temperatures are rising in most temperate and polar environments, and a welldocumented effect of this change is a poleward range shift by a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic species. In the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM), an increasing number of tropical species have recently become established among the extant warm-temperate fauna. These include a diversity of tropical fishes, manatees, green turtles, warm-water corals, and black mangroves. The impact of these species may be profound, primarily because temperate species are restricted from shifting northward by the North American land mass. Thus, as tropical species expand northward in the GOM, they must interact with the extant species and potentially compete for essential resources or become prey for each other. Here we focus on tropical immigrants capable of transforming the vast and highly productive seagrass systems of the northern GOM, emphasizing herbivorous parrotfishes and comparing their impact with endemic seagrass-resident fishes. Increased numbers of these herbivores (plus green turtles and manatees) would likely shift detritus-based food webs in seagrass meadows to webs dominated by direct consumption of seagrasses. We provide estimates of some expected consumption rates and effects of these tropically associated seagrass herbivores and predict that the consequences of the increased tropicalization of northern GOM seagrass meadows will be: substantially reduced standing crops and structural complexity of seagrass meadows; increased energy flux through grazing food webs; and a greatly reduced nursery role that will result in much smaller adult populations of those finfish and shellfish species that rely on seagrasses as nurseries. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2015.},

Through the study of mesocosms harboring a diverse benthic coastal community, we reveal that food web architecture can be inflexible under ocean warming and acidification and unable to compensate for the decline or proliferation of taxa. Key stabilizing processes, including functional redundancy, trophic compensation, and species substitution, were largely absent under future climate conditions. A trophic pyramid emerged in which biomass expanded at the base and top but contracted in the center. This structure may characterize a transitionary state before collapse into shortened, bottom-heavy food webs that characterize ecosystems subject to persistent abiotic stress. We show that where food web architecture lacks adjustability, the adaptive capacity of ecosystems to global change is weak and ecosystem degradation likely.},

This has precluded a robust overview of the effect of climate change in the global ocean. Here, we synthesized all available studies of the consistency of marine ecological observations with expectations under climate change. This yielded a meta-database of 1,735 marine biological responses for which either regional or global climate change was considered as a driver. Included were instances of marine taxa responding as expected, in a manner inconsistent with expectations, and taxa demonstrating no response. From this database, 81-83% of all observations for distribution, phenology, community composition, abundance, demography and calcification across taxa and ocean basins were consistent with the expected impacts of climate change. Of the species responding to climate change, rates of distribution shifts were, on average, consistent with those required to track ocean surface temperature changes. Conversely, we did not find a relationship between regional shifts in spring phenology and the seasonality of temperature. Rates of observed shifts in species' distributions and phenology are comparable to, or greater, than those for terrestrial systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The exchange of individuals among habitat patches (connectivity) has broad relevance for the conservation and management of marine metapopulations. Elemental fingerprinting-based research conducted over the past 12 years along the open coastline and bays of San Diego County in southern California evaluated connectivity patterns for seven species: one native and two invasive mussels, an oyster, a brachyuran crab, and two fishes. The studies spanned different years and seasons but overlapped considerably in space, allowing comparisons of dispersal patterns across species, and assess-ment of the relative importance of location, circulation, and intra-annual and inter-annual variability. We asked whether the species exhibited commonalities in directional transport, transport distances, sources and sinks, self-recruitment, and bay-ocean exchange. Linked connectivity-demographic analyses conducted for two species of mytilid mussels and two fishes allowed evaluation of the contributions of realized connectivity to metapopulation dynamics relative to other life-history attributes. Common trends across species include average along-shore dispersal distances of 15–35 km and seasonal changes in direction of dispersal that mirrored patterns of along-shore circulation. We observed greater isolation of back-bay populations, significant exchange from front bay to ocean, and high self-recruitment in locations on the northern, open coast, and in the southern bays. Connectivity was rarely the most influential driver of growth and persistence of metapopulations, but influenced the importance of other vital rates. Several locations served consistently as sources of larvae or as nurseries for multiple species, but there were few sites in common that were sinks. For the mussels, reproductive timing guided directional transport. These results imply that local management (e.g., habitat protection, opening of the mouths of lagoons, location of aquaculture farms) may be effective along this coastline. Regional, multi-species assessments of exchange of larvae should move us closer to ecosystem-based management.},

abstract = {Shallow marine ecosystems are threatened by human impacts. The prospect that deeper environments could serve as refugia is promising but remains uncertain, as it has been evaluated primarily in benthic taxa and on small spatial scales. We use a dataset of all biota from the Gulf of Mexico to evaluate the degree to which species' occurrences extend across shallow (0-30 m), mesophotic (>30-150 m), and deep (>150 m) environments. High percentages of species inhabit multiple depth zones: 70% of benthic and 81% of pelagic species occurring in the mesophotic zone are also found in the shallow zone, and 45% of benthic and 80% of pelagic species found in the shallow zone extend into mesophotic depths. After accounting for confounding effects using logistic regression, pelagic species have significantly higher odds of extending between depth zones than benthic species. Analyses of species in adjacent 20 m depth bands reveal taxonomically distinct communities of benthic species from 0 to 100 m and pelagic species from 0 to 200 m. Peaks in probability distributions show that pelagic species generally have broader depth ranges than benthic species. Depth ranges that overlap between deeper and shallower zones show that movement of individuals or propagules in one or both directions between these habitats is either occurring now or has occurred in the past. Over the long term, deeper habitats can allow species to escape regional extirpation, and can contribute to the resilience and persistence of coastal ecosystems in the face of increased disturbance in shallow water. This is particularly true when pelagic species are considered.},

abstract = {Staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) and elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata), are important reef builders in the Caribbean. In the early to middle Holocene (10000-6000 years ago), when sea temperatures were warmer than today, Acropora-dominated reefs were common along the east coast of Florida as far north as Palm Beach County. The fossil record shows that the northern limits of these two cold-sensitive species subsequently contracted to Biscayne Bay, south of Miami, apparently as a result of climatic cooling. This response of the Acropora species to climate provides a context for interpreting recent shifts in their geographic distribution. Despite recent disease-induced mass mortalities throughout the Caribbean and western Atlantic, the two species are now re-expanding their ranges northward along the Florida Peninsula and into the northern Gulf of Mexico, coincident with increasing sea temperatures. In the face of continued global warming, the northernmost limit of this range expansion will ultimately be determined by a combination of temperature and other physical constraints.},

abstract = {Climate change involves modifications in both the mean and the variability of temperature and precipitation. According to global warming projections, both the magnitude and the frequency of extreme weather events are increasing, thereby increasing climate variability. The previous studies have reported that climate warming tends to decrease biodiversity and the temporal stability of community primary productivity (i.e., community stability), but the effects of the variability of temperature and precipitation on biodiversity, community stability, and their relationship have not been clearly explored. We used a long-term (from 1982 to 2014) field data set from a temperate grassland in northern China to explore the effects of the variability of mean temperature and total precipitation on species richness, community stability, and their relationship. Results showed that species richness promoted community stability through increases in asynchronous dynamics across species (i.e., species asynchrony). Both species richness and species asynchrony were positively associated with the residuals of community stability after controlling for its dependence on the variability of mean temperature and total precipitation. Furthermore, the variability of mean temperature reduced species richness, while the variability of total precipitation decreased species asynchrony and community stability. Overall, the present study revealed that species richness and species asynchrony promoted community stability, but increased climate variability may erode these positive effects and thereby threaten community stability.},

We first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

In this study, from a warm-temperate, high salinity, salt marsh-dominated estuary in the southeastern USA, decreases in overall abundance, shifts in species and life stage composition, and changes in seasonal patterns of occurrence coincided with increased water temperature. Biweekly trawl collections in a subtidal creek were made during two 4-year periods separated by more than 30 years. Of the total 111 taxa in the North Inlet estuary, South Carolina, 64% (71) occurred during both the historic (1981–84) and recent (2013–16) periods. The top five species and their proportions of the total annual catches changed between periods. In the recent study period, near-bottom species (Lagodon rhomboides, Bairdiella chrysoura, Litopenaeus setiferus) increased, and pelagic species (Anchoa spp. and Lolliguncula brevis) decreased. The mean abundance of total nekton in the recent period was approximately 50% of historic abundance. Large, but temporary increases in nekton abundance occurred when salinity decreased after major storms. In the recent study period, shifts in the timing of peak abundances from spring to fall, the occurrence of juveniles during winter, and increased diversity suggested responses to significantly warmer winters and summers. Over the 30 year period, the subtidal nekton assemblage transitioned to a state of lower abundance and different composition. Future increases in water temperature, incidences of major storms, and modifications of estuarine habitats due to rising sea level could lead to additional changes in the fauna of warm-temperate estuaries.},

abstract = {In marine ecosystems, rising atmospheric CO2 and climate change are associated with concurrent shifts in temperature, circulation, stratification, nutrient input, oxygen content, and ocean acidification, with potentially wide-ranging biological effects. Population-level shifts are occurring because of physiological intolerance to new environments, altered dispersal patterns, and changes in species interactions. Together with local climate-driven invasion and extinction, these processes result in altered community structure and diversity, including possible emergence of novel ecosystems. Impacts are particularly striking for the poles and the tropics, because of the sensitivity of polar ecosystems to sea-ice retreat and poleward species migrations as well as the sensitivity of coral-algal symbiosis to minor increases in temperature. Midlatitude upwelling systems, like the California Current, exhibit strong linkages between climate and species distributions, phenology, and demography. Aggregated effects may modify energy and material flows as well as biogeochemical cycles, eventually impacting the overall ecosystem functioning and services upon which people and societies depend.},

These are, respectively, the BAS (Baselga 2010, Global Ecology and Biogeography, 19, 134-143) and POD (Podani & Schmera . Oikos, 120, 1625-1638) frameworks. We conduct a systematic comparison of parallel components in alternative approaches. We test whether the replacement components derived from the BAS and POD frameworks are independent of richness difference. We also evaluate whether previously reported tests of monotonicity between indices and ecological processes are informative to assess the performance of indices. Finally, we illustrate the consequences of differences between the BAS and POD frameworks using the North American freshwater fish fauna as an empirical example. In the BAS framework, the nestedness-resultant component ($\beta$<inf>jne</inf> or $\beta$<inf>sne</inf>) accounts only for richness differences derived from nested patterns while, in the POD framework, richness-difference dissimilarity ($\beta$<inf>rich</inf> or $\beta$<inf>rich.s</inf>) accounts for all kind of richness differences. Likewise, the replacement components of both alternative methods account for different concepts. Only the replacement component of the BAS framework ($\beta$<inf>jtu</inf> or $\beta$<inf>sim</inf>) is independent of richness difference, while the parallel component in the POD framework ($\beta$<inf>-3</inf> or $\beta$<inf>-3.s</inf>) is not (i.e. it is mathematically constrained by richness difference). Therefore, only the BAS framework allows separating (i) the variation in species composition derived from species replacement which is independent of richness difference (i.e. not mathematically constrained by it) and (ii) the variation in species composition derived from nested patterns.},

Assemblages were sampled twice yearly (spring and summer) at day and night using beach seines. Assemblage stability was examined over time along with changes in assemblage structure across time of day and season, including the influence of temporally variable abiotic variables. Only the occasionally occurring fish, those present in <70% of samples, in Mission Bay appeared to be shifting to a new assemblage. Although season and sampling time significantly affected assemblages, correlations with abiotic factors were low. Given the long history of urban development of these estuaries, community shifts may have occurred prior to the onset of sampling, giving the appearance of stability. Alternatively, eelgrass habitat may be providing a refuge from long-term disturbances.},

It was first hypothesised that NIS assemblages in the recreational marinas were subsets of those occurring in commercial harbours. However, the data did not consistently support this hypothesis: the NIS pools of some marinas significantly diverged from harbours even belonging to the same coastal stretches, including NIS occurring only in marinas. This study confirms harbours as hotspots for marine NIS, but also reveals that numbers of NIS in some marinas is higher than expected, suggesting that recreational vessels effectively facilitate NIS spread. It is recommended that this vector of NIS introduction is taken into account in the future planning of sustainable development of maritime tourism in Europe.},

abstract = {Environmental stress gradients can affect species distributions and interspecific interactions. Because environmental stress depends on both intensity and duration, understanding the consequences of stress requires experiments that simultaneously manipulate both dimensions. In Apalachicola Bay, Florida (U.S.A.) the southern oyster drill (Stramonita haemastoma) is a major predator of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica). Drill predation appears to be salinity-dependent: in a recent field study, predation rates were positively correlated with salinity. Salinity in the bay is typically high (> 20) during the dry summer months, conditions that favor both oysters and the drill. However, periodic freshets can dramatically reduce salinity, which inhibits (or kills) drills, but not oysters. In this study, we used field measurements of salinity and drill densities to inform mesocosm experiments. We investigated the specific combinations of intensity and duration of low-salinity stress that inhibit drill predation. In these experiments, more intense salinity reductions reduced feeding both during and after the low-salinity stress event. During the event, longer durations (15 d) were necessary for mild salinity reductions (−5) to reduce the feeding rate by the same amount as a short (5 d) exposure of more intense (−10 or −15) salinity reduction. Both conditions may create a predation refuge for oysters, consistent with field observations. Given that the recent collapse of the Apalachicola Bay oyster population was preceded by several years without low-salinity events to inhibit predation, our results provide a mechanism by which a predator may have contributed to the loss of a historically productive and sustainable fishery.},

abstract = {Climate change is causing the distribution and abundance of many organisms to change. In particular, organisms typical of the tropics are increasing in abundance in many subtropical regions, a process known as tropicalization. Here, we examine changes in coral abundance and assemblage structure in the Solitary Islands Marine Park (SIMP), over a 23-year period between 1990 and 2013–14. Total coral cover decreased at all six islands sampled with a concomitant decline in total coral cover at the regional scale (i.e. between sampling occasions). When coral taxa were classified as either cosmopolitan or subtropical, cosmopolitan corals decreased in cover at the regional scale. In contrast, subtropical coral cover did not change at the regional scale because large increases in cover at some islands, such as North Solitary Island, were matched by decreases at other islands. Of 16 common coral taxa examined at the regional level, one declined and two increased in cover with no change in the remaining 13 taxa. In particular, there was no increase in the abundance of coral taxa typically associated with tropical reefs. Similarly, multivariate analyses of coral assemblage structure using these 16 common taxa indicated changes in two of the six island assemblages but, again, provided no evidence for tropicalization. Modelling suggested very low probabilities of larval dispersal from the southern Great Barrier Reef to the SIMP suggesting that limited connectivity with tropical coral populations is one possible cause of the lack of tropicalization in the coral assemblages. We therefore conclude that, despite significant increases in mean sea surface temperature over the last few decades, there has been no tropicalization of the coral fauna in the SIMP. Furthermore, the small proportional reduction in total coral cover, despite the occasional incidence of coral bleaching, coral disease outbreaks and a number of large storms, suggest that the reefs of the SIMP were in reasonably good health at the time of the final survey in 2014. Our results suggest that factors other than temperature, in particular, a lack of dispersal, are limiting the expansion of tropical corals along the east coast of Australia.},

We investigate a three-decade time series of estuarine fishes and show that the abundances of the individual species fluctuate asynchronously around their mean levels.We then use a time-series modelling approach to examine the consequences of different patterns of turnover, by asking how the correlation between the abundance of a species in a given year and its abundance in the previous year influences the structure of the overall assemblage. Classical diversity measures that ignore species identities reveal that the observed assemblage structure will persist under all but the most extreme conditions. However, metrics that track species identities indicate a narrower set of turnover scenarios under which the predicted assemblage resembles the natural one. Our study suggests that species diversity metrics are insensitive to change and that measures that track species ranks may provide better early warning that an assemblage is being perturbed. It also highlights the need to incorporate temporal turnover in investigations of assemblage structure and function. This journal is {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

Plastic responses to changes in temperature are generally well understood, though most experimental studies to date have used constant temperature regimes, the reliability of which is under debate. We here investigate plastic responses in the widespread butterfly Pieris napi to simulated climate change, using ecologically realistic diurnal temperature cycles and current and predicted temperature regimes including effects of a heat wave. Increasing the temperature mean by 3 °C predominantly affected developmental times, cold resistance and adult life span, while an increase in the diurnal temperature amplitude had very little effects. Immune function responded only weakly to different thermal regimes. The simulation of a prolonged heat wave severely impaired juvenile survival, body size and longevity, supporting the wide-held notion that extreme weather events will be much more important for species' performance and local survival than moderate increases in temperature means. Given that the frequency of extreme weather events is predicted to increase with climate change, even widespread species may be negatively affected. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan.},

During 2006–2007 we sampled seagrass meadows using the same gears and methods previously employed by R. J. Livingston in coastal waters of northwest Florida throughout the 1970s. Comparisons between datasets revealed numerous additions to the fish fauna during 2006–2007 that were completely absent in the 1970s, including: Lutjanus synagris (lane snapper), Epinephelus morio (red grouper), Chaetodon ocellatus (spotfin butterflyfish), Mycteroperca sp (grouper, non gag), Centropristis philadelphica (rock sea bass), Fistularia tabacaria (bluespotted cornetfish), Ocyurus chrysurus (yellowtail snapper), Thalassoma bifasciatum (bluehead wrasse), Abu- defduf saxatilis (sergeant major), Acanthuridae spp. (surgeonfishes) and Sparisoma viride (stoplight parrotfish). Several other species showed large increases in abundance during the interval between 1979 and 2006, including Mycteroperca microlepis (gag grouper, up ? 200?), Lutjanus griseus (gray snapper, up ? 105?), and Nicholsina usta (emerald parrotfish, up ? 22?). All of these are tropical or subtropical species that now make up a greater percentage of seagrass-associated fish assemblages in the northernGOMthan in the past. Additionally, we observed regional increases in air and sea surface temperatures (43 1C) during the ? 30 years that separate Livingston's samples and ours that correlate with northern shifts in the distribution of warm-water fishes. Documenting these range shifts is a critical first step in investigating the consequences of globalwarming for endemic marine communities and fishery production in the northern GOM. Keywords:},

abstract = {Biological assessments have been used for decades to determine ecological conditions in aquatic environments, yet they have not been extensively applied in estuaries that serve as transition zones between freshwater and marine environments. We present the development and validation of a nekton (fish and selected macroinvertebrate) index for annual monitoring of ecosystem health in Tampa Bay, Florida. We relied on long-term fisheries independent monitoring data of the early recruit and juvenile life history stages of nekton in Florida's inshore waters. A set of metrics that included measures of abundance, species diversity, trophic structure, and taxa of commercial or recreational importance were explored, and a subset was selected via statistical models. Reference conditions specific to each season and management section of the bay were established from the long-term dataset. The final Tampa Bay Nekton Index included five metrics: the total number of taxa, the number of benthic taxa, the number of recreational/commercial fishery taxa, the number of feeding guilds, and the Shannon-Weiner diversity index. Nekton index scores were calculated for each sample and averaged by bay management section and year and then a “stoplight” color-coding system, based on quantiles, was used to group index scores for communication and management. In general, Tampa Bay's nekton community appears to be resistant to large-scale changes in functional structure. The index was sensitive to a prolonged red tide event but eventually returned to preperturbation levels, indicating nekton community resilience. This index will be incorporated into monitoring and managing strategies of the local estuary program. Because this index was developed specifically for Tampa Bay and relies on bay-specific reference conditions, the index cannot be directly applied to other systems, but the methodology is transferrable so similar indices could be developed for other ecosystems with long-term monitoring data. Furthermore, using regional data, the index could be expanded/developed to assess health status among estuaries to inform decisions on prioritization of limited resources.},

Models often achieve this fit at the expense of exaggerated complexity that is not justified by empirical evidence. Because overfitted theories complement the traditional assumption that ecology is 'messy', they generally remain unquestioned. Using predation theory as an example, we suggest that a fit-driven appraisal of model value is commonly misdirected; although fit to historical data can be important, the simplicity and generality of a theory - and thus its ecological value - are of comparable importance. In particular, we argue that theories whose complexity greatly exceeds the complexity of the problem that they address should be rejected.

@article{Michaud2022,
abstract = {A multi-parameter dataset from 13 Florida estuaries demonstrated complications that multiple gradients (the estuarine gradient complex, EGC) 1 impose when trying to characterize species distributions using regression-based analyses. Variation in the beta diversity of assemblages consisting of 974 taxa in four groups (ichthyoplankton, invertebrate zooplankton, seine nekton, trawl nekton) were assessed using 29 habitat factors. Habitat data were obtained from measurements made during biotic collections, associated characterizations of local habitats, data obtained from the United States Environmental Protection Agency Storage and Retrieval database, and from data that characterized the timing and magnitude of freshwater inflow and turnover. When all habitat factors were used in multivariate regression models (distance-based redundancy analysis, dbRDA) with the objective of explaining variation in beta diversity, the models accounted for as much as 52% of the variation and included factors such as salinity, color, water temperature, distance to the Gulf of Mexico, water depth, presence of mud bottom, and the amount of freshwater input. Habitat factors that contributed to the EGC were identified by performing correlation analyses between each habitat factor and distance to the Gulf of Mexico. This step indicated that, in surface-fed estuaries, submerged aquatic vegetation, mangroves, and warmer temperatures were more common downstream, and lower pH, deeper depths, lower bottom dissolved oxygen, lawn-and-tree shorelines, and manmade bottom substrates were more common upstream. In spring-fed estuaries, oysters and mangroves were more common downstream, and lawn-and-tree shorelines were more common upstream. These correlated factors were used to represent the EGC and were explicitly included in dbRDAs where they explained as much as 78% of the variability in beta diversity. A subsequent partial-dbRDA was performed on the variation that was not explained by EGC habitat factors, and non-EGC factors (freshwater inputs, artificial shorelines, shoreline slope, and the presence of sand bottom) explained as much as an additional 7% of the variability. These results demonstrate the complications inherent in assigning influence to any one habitat factor in estuaries where many habitat factors covary spatially. The substantial amount of beta diversity variation explained by the EGC indicates a goal of estuarine management should be to promote heterogeneity in habitat factors contained in the EGC to maintain overall community diversity.},

abstract = {Southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma) support valuable North American fisheries and show great promise for aquaculture. Because females grow faster and reach larger adult sizes than males, monosex culture of females is desirable for commercial operations. A detailed understanding of sexual development and its timing is critical to control sex and optimize culture. Structural and cellular sex-distinguishing markers were identified histologically, and then used to describe ovarian development in female and testicular development in male flounder. In presumptive ovaries of southern flounder, development of an ovarian cavity first occurs in fish ranging from 75 to 100 mm total length (TL). This is considerably delayed relative to that observed in the Japanese congener, Paralichthys olivaceus, where an ovarian cavity is seen in fish as small as 40 mm TL. The smallest southern flounder that possessed primary oocytes in the early perinucleolus stage was 115 mm TL. In presumptive testes, the formation of seminiferous tubules first occurs in fish of approximately 100 mm TL. Spermatogonia remained quiescent until most fish were over 100 mm TL. Overall, gonads from southern flounder greater than 120 mm TL commonly possess gonial cells undergoing meiosis, clearly differentiating sex. The effect of temperature on sex determination in southern flounder was addressed in a separate experiment. Juvenile southern flounder were grown at 18, 23, or 28°C for 245 days. High and low temperatures induced phenotypic sex reversal in juvenile southern flounder, producing a higher proportion of males (96% males at high temperature, P<0.001, 78% males at low temperature, P<0.01). Raising southern flounder at the midrange temperature held sex ratios close to 1:1. Sex ratios from these trials suggest that southern flounder possess a temperature-sensitive mechanism of sex determination similar to that shown for P. olivaceus, but possibly shifted towards warmer temperatures. These findings indicate that sex differentiation in southern flounder is distinguishable in most fish by 100-120 mm TL and that sex determination is sensitive to temperature. This information is critical to the development of strategies to maximize the number of faster-growing females for commercial flounder culture. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Cottonwoods are poplar trees that are well adapted to dynamic riparian, or streamside, zones throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Here we assess the influences of three prominent physical disturbances, floods, fire, and ice, on cottonwood population ecology. We emphasize cottonwoods along rivers from the "Crown of the Continent", the central Rocky Mountain zone around the Canada - United States border, where five Populus species overlap and four hybridize. Moderate to major floods scour banks and deposit bars, creating barren and moist colonization sites that are essential for cottonwood seedling recruitment. Floods also scarify shallow roots, thus promoting clonal suckering, especially for the section Tacamahaca species: narrowleaf cottonwood (Populus angustifolia James), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.), and black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa Torr. & A. Gray). Fire would naturally be less frequent in some riparian zones because of the moist conditions and firebreaks provided by the streams, but with human use, floodplain forest fires have probably increased. Following fire, regrowth through clonal root and shoot suckers can be prolific for the Tacamahaca species, but is limited for the section Aigeiros, prairie cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr.). River ice, and especially ice drives that accompany winter or spring break-up, provide powerful riparian disturbances that have often been neglected. Ice drives generate barren sites for seedling colonization, shear shoots, and scarify roots promoting shoot and root suckering, and sever branches, enabling dispersive clonal branch propagation. Following studies along many regional rivers, we conclude that: (i) riparian cottonwoods are tolerant of, and dependent upon, occasional physical disturbance for population rejuvenation; (ii) differing disturbance responses contribute to niche differentiation across the Populus species; (iii) different disturbances enable varied spatial and temporal patterns of cottonwood establishment, including fringe, general, and patch recruitment; and (iv) natural disturbance regimes probably favor native cottonwoods and disfavor some invasive, woody plants. River damming and flow regulation often attempt to attenuate flood and ice disturbance, a management objective that may hinder the perpetuation of native floodplain forests. We recommend that river resource managers seek to allow flood and ice disturbance, and additionally, fire may provide a managed disturbance that could rejuvenate overmature cottonwood groves along some regulated rivers. {\textcopyright} 2007 NRC.},

abstract = {Ongoing and projected climate change is likely to greatly alter co-occurring stressor mechanisms, yet these potential interactions remain poorly understood in natural freshwater systems worldwide. As the global biodiversity crisis deepens, successful conservation efforts will hinge on developing mechanistic multiple stressor frameworks that have been ground-truthed in natural systems containing complex species dynamics and ecological processes. Our study examined the combined and interacting effects of potential climate and land use stressors on boreal stream fishes using data from over 300 catchments across a broad 250,000 km2 region. To characterize boreal fish community health, we examined four indicators including species richness, total catch per unit effort, the proportion of lithophilic spawners (fish sensitive to sedimentation), and the assemblage tolerance index which provides a measurement of the overall community tolerance to disturbance. Land use stressors included total anthropogenic land use area and linear disturbance at multiple watershed scales as well as two site-specific habitat degradation indicators (dissolved oxygen and the proportion of fine substrate). Overall community richness and productivity were not negatively related to land use changes indicating potential compensatory dynamics (e.g. where intolerant species are replaced with more tolerant species as habitat quality degrades). In contrast, we observed declines for sensitive species, including highly valued salmonids, that varied depending on interactions between local climate, land use, and stream type. Sensitive species declines were concentrated in regions experiencing increased land use and warming, whereas increases were observed in cooler regions consistent with a subsidy-stress response. In addition, lithophilic spawners declined in watersheds experiencing warmer and wetter conditions owing to potential indirect effects on spawning habitat quality. Results from our study provide novel insight into complex climate and land use interactions occurring across a broad, real-world landscape, and highlight the potential for amplified species declines under future warming and land use scenarios.},

abstract = {The latitudinal gradient in species richness, with more species in the tropics and richness declining with latitude, is widely known and has been assumed to be stable over recent centuries. We analyzed data on 48,661 marine animal species since 1955, accounting for sampling variation, to assess whether the global latitudinal gradient in species richness is being impacted by climate change. We confirm recent studies that show a slight dip in species richness at the equator. Moreover, richness across latitudinal bands was sensitive to temperature, reaching a plateau or declining above a mean annual sea surface temperature of 20 °C for most taxa. In response, since the 1970s, species richness has declined at the equator relative to an increase at midlatitudes and has shifted north in the northern hemisphere, particularly among pelagic species. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that climate change is impacting the latitudinal gradient in marine biodiversity at a global scale. The intensification of the dip in species richness at the equator, especially for pelagic species, suggests that it is already too warm there for some species to survive.},

abstract = {Tropicalization is a term used to describe the transformation of temperate ecosystems by poleward-moving tropical organisms in response to warming temperatures. In North America, decreases in the frequency and intensity of extreme winter cold events are expected to allow the poleward range expansion of many cold-sensitive tropical organisms, sometimes at the expense of temperate organisms. Although ecologists have long noted the critical ecological role of winter cold temperature extremes in tropical–temperate transition zones, the ecological effects of extreme cold events have been understudied, and the influence of warming winter temperatures has too often been left out of climate change vulnerability assessments. Here, we examine the influence of extreme cold events on the northward range limits of a diverse group of tropical organisms, including terrestrial plants, coastal wetland plants, coastal fishes, sea turtles, terrestrial reptiles, amphibians, manatees, and insects. For these organisms, extreme cold events can lead to major physiological damage or landscape-scale mass mortality. Conversely, the absence of extreme cold events can foster population growth, range expansion, and ecological regime shifts. We discuss the effects of warming winters on species and ecosystems in tropical–temperate transition zones. In the 21st century, climate change-induced decreases in the frequency and intensity of extreme cold events are expected to facilitate the poleward range expansion of many tropical species.

These analyses complement an analogous and more voluminous body of work from the tropical Indo-Pacific. The Caribbean is more limited in area with smaller inter-island distances than the Indo-Pacific, providing a unique context to consider fundamental processes likely to affect richness patterns of reef fish.Location† Caribbean Sea.Methods† We compiled a set of data describing reef-associated fish assemblages from 24 island nations across the Caribbean Sea, representing a wide range of isolation and varying in land area from 53 to 110,860 km2. Regression-based analyses compared the univariate and combined effects of island-specific physical predictors on fish species richness.Results† We found that diversity of reef-associated fishes increases strongly with increasing island area and with decreasing isolation. Richness also increases with increasing nearshore productivity. Analyses of various subsets of the entire data set reveal the robustness of the richness data and biogeographical patterns.Main conclusions† Within the relatively small and densely packed Caribbean basin, fish species richness fits the classical species2013area relationship. Richness also was related negatively to isolation, suggesting direct effects of dispersal limitation in community assembly. Because oceanic productivity was correlated with isolation, however, the related effects of system-wide productivity on richness cannot be disentangled. These results highlight fundamental mechanisms that underlie spatial patterns of biodiversity among Caribbean coral reefs, and which are probably also are functioning in the more widespread and heterogeneous reefs of the Indo-Pacific.},

abstract = {Phenological mismatch results when interacting species change the timing of regularly repeated phases in their life cycles at different rates. We review whether this continuously ongoing phenomenon, also known as trophic asynchrony, is becoming more common under ongoing rapid climate change. In antagonistic trophic interactions, any mismatch will have negative impacts for only one of the species, whereas in mutualistic interactions, both partners are expected to suffer. Trophic mismatch is therefore expected to last for evolutionarily short periods, perhaps only a few seasons, adding to the difficulty of attributing it to climate change, which requires long-term data. So far, the prediction that diverging phenologies linked to climate change will cause mismatch is most clearly met in antagonistic interactions at high latitudes in the Artic. There is limited evidence of phenological mismatch in mutualistic interactions, possibly because of strong selection on mutualists to have co-adapted phenological strategies. The study of individual plasticity, population variation, and the genetic bases for phenological strategies is in its infancy. Recent work on woody plants revealed the large imprint of historic climate change on temperature, chilling, and day-length thresholds used by different species to synchronize their phenophases, which in the Northern Hemisphere has led to biogeographic phenological regions in which long-lived plants have adapted to particular interannual and intermillennial amplitudes of climate change.},

Species' associations control how communities are formed, but the effect of winter warming on associations will be on average four times greater than that of summer warming. Projections using future climate scenarios show that 60% of coastal Mediterranean grid cells are expected to lose fish species by 2040.

abstract = {The tropically associated black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) is expanding into salt marshes of the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM). This species has colonized temperate systems dominated by smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) in Texas, Louisiana, Florida and, most recently, Mississippi. To date, little is known about the habitat value of black mangroves for juvenile fish and invertebrates. Here we compare benthic epifauna, infauna, and nekton use of Spartina-dominated, Avicennia-dominated, and mixed Spartina and black mangrove habitats in two areas with vary-ing densities and ages of black mangroves. Faunal samples and sediment cores were collected monthly from April to October in 2012 and 2013 from Horn Island, MS, and twice yearly in the Chandeleur Islands, LA. Multivariate analysis suggested benthic epifauna communities differed significantly between study location and among habitat types, with a sig-nificant interaction between the two fixed factors. Differences in mangrove and marsh community composition were greater at the Chandeleurs than at Horn Island, perhaps because of the distinct mangrove/marsh ecotone and the high density and age of mangroves there. Infaunal abundances were significantly higher at Horn Island, with tanaids acting as the main driver of differences between study locations. We predict that if black mangroves continue to increase in abundance in the northern GOM, estuarine faunal community composition could shift substantially because black mangroves typically colonize shorelines at higher elevations than smooth cordgrass, resulting in habitats of differing complexity and flooding duration.},

abstract = { Most passive acoustic studies of the soundscape rely on fixed recorders, which provide good temporal resolution of variation in the soundscape, but poor spatial coverage. In contrast, a mobile recording device can show variation in the soundscape over large spatial areas. We used a Liquid Robotics SV2 wave glider fitted with a tow body with a passive acoustic recorder and hydrophone, to survey and record the soundscape of the Atlantic Ocean off North Carolina (United States). Recordings were analyzed using power spectral band (PSB) sums in frequencies associated with soniferous fish species in the families Sciaenidae (drums and croakers), Ophidiidae (cusk-eels), Batrachoididae (toadfish), Triglidae (sea robins), and Serranidae (groupers). PSB sums were plotted as the wave glider moved offshore and along the coast, came back inshore, and circled artificial and natural reefs. The soundscape in water <20 m was dominated by nocturnal fish choruses with PSB sums > 120 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa 2 : a Sciaenidae mixed-species chorus, an unknown “grunt” chorus, an unknown “buzz” chorus, and an Ophidiidae chorus. The Ophidiidae and unknown “buzz” fish choruses dominated in the range of 1600–3200 Hz and were similar in sound pressure level (SPL) to the US Navy recordings made at Cape Lookout (136 dB in 2017 vs. 131 dB in 1943). In deeper water (27–30 m), we recorded Triglidae “honks,” oyster toadfish “boat whistles,” Sciaenidae “booms” and “clucks,” and grouper “growls.” We recorded a nocturnal 5600–Hz signal while the glider was passing near known live bottom reefs and artificial reefs. Vessel noise (100–200 Hz) was part of the soundscape in shipping lanes as large cargo vessels passed by the glider. Rainfall and thunder were also part of the soundscape. The maximum SPL observed (148 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa) occurred during a mixed-species Sciaenidae fish chorus near Cape Lookout that was dominated by unknown “grunt” calls. Passive acoustic monitoring from mobile platforms can be used to discover and map the locations of fish choruses, identify areas of their habitat use, and locate previously unknown locations of reefs and fish spawning areas during ocean surveys. },

abstract = {Climate fluctuations affect a wide range of environmental factors that may impact fish populations with various response mechanisms. For a major part of world fisheries stocks, only abundance time-series are available. Relations between abundance of these species and ocean variables, including long term trends and patterns of seasonal change, remain sparsely documented. The main aim of our work is to determine to what extent effects of inter-annual and seasonal changes in environmental factors can be identified and quantified on a selected time-series of abundance data-set: the striped red mullet population within the Bay of Biscay. 8 Landings per unit of effort (LPUE) for striped red mullet data are compared with environmental covariates extracted from the Copernicus web database. Our strategy is to decompose the patterns of change in fish populations into long-term and seasonal components and to analyse the possible dependency of both components on environmental factors. The overall tendencies are a decrease of the long-term component and a modification of the seasonality, with additional spatial variability. The observed tendencies and seasonal changes are discussed against the spatio-temporal patterns of change in environmental factors. High spatial heterogeneity within the Bay of Biscay was found, both for striped red mullet long-term trends and seasonal changes. Most inter-annual and seasonal changes in striped red mullet abundance can be related to environmental factors. In addition to the well-known annual fluctuation, most coastal sites revealed a bi-annual seasonality possibly related to the recruitment process.},

abstract = {This review focuses on the analysis of temporal beta diversity, which is the variation in community composition along time in a study area. Temporal beta diversity is measured by the variance of themultivariate community composition time series and that variance can be partitioned using appropriate statistical methods. Some of these methods are classical, such as simple or canonical ordination, whereas others are recent, including the methods of temporal eigenfunction analysis developed for multiscale exploration (i.e. addressing several scales of variation) of univariate or multivariate response data, reviewed, to our knowledge for the first time in this review. These methods are illustrated with ecological data from 13 years of benthic surveys in Chesapeake Bay, USA. The following methods are applied to the Chesapeake data: distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps, asymmetric eigenvector maps, scalogram, variation partitioning, multivariate correlogram, multivariate regression tree, and two-way MANOVA to study temporal and space-time variability. Local (temporal) contributions to beta diversity (LCBD indices) are computed and analysed graphically and by regression against environmental variables, and the role of species in determining the LCBD values is analysed by correlation analysis. A tutorial detailing the analyses in the R language is provided in an appendix. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) is a powerful statistical tool which enables complex multivariate data sets to be visualized in a reduced number of dimensions. Users typically evaluate the fit of an NMDS ordination via ordination “stress” (i.e., data distortion) against a commonly accepted set of heuristic guidelines. However, these guidelines do not account for the mathematical relationship which links ordination stress to sample size. Consequently, researchers working with large data sets may unnecessarily present ordinations in an intractable number of dimensions, subdivide their data, or forego the use of NMDS entirely and lose the benefits of this highly flexible and useful technique. In order to overcome the limitations of these practices, we advocate for an alternative approach to the evaluation of NMDS ordination fit via the usage of permutation-based ecological null models. We present the rationale for this approach from a theoretical basis, supported by a brief literature review, and an example usage of the methodology. Our literature review shows that NMDS analyses often far exceed the number of observations under which the original stress guidelines were formulated—with a significant increasing trend in recent decades. Adoption of a permutation-based approach will consequently provide a more flexible and quantitative evaluation of NMDS fit and allow for the continued application of NMDS in an era of increasingly large datasets.},

Focusing on the American diet, we evaluated the number of microplastic particles in commonly consumed foods in relation to their recommended daily intake. The potential for microplastic inhalation and how the source of drinking water may affect microplastic consumption were also explored. Our analysis used 402 data points from 26 studies, which represents over 3600 processed samples. Evaluating approximately 15% of Americans' caloric intake, we estimate that annual microplastics consumption ranges from 39000 to 52000 particles depending on age and sex. These estimates increase to 74000 and 121000 when inhalation is considered. Additionally, individuals who meet their recommended water intake through only bottled sources may be ingesting an additional 90000 microplastics annually, compared to 4000 microplastics for those who consume only tap water. These estimates are subject to large amounts of variation; however, given methodological and data limitations, these values are likely underestimates.},

Analysis of samples from sub-surface plankton tows conducted in close proximity to inshore reefs on the central GBR revealed microplastics, similar to those used in marine paints and fishing floats, were present in low concentrations at all water sampling locations. Experimental feeding trials revealed that corals mistake microplastics for prey and can consume up to $\sim$50 $\mu$g plastic cm−2 h−1, rates similar to their consumption of plankton and Artemia nauplii in experimental feeding assays. Ingested microplastics were found wrapped in mesenterial tissue within the coral gut cavity, suggesting that ingestion of high concentrations of microplastic debris could potentially impair the health of corals.},

Progress toward speciation in this model consists of association of a third locus, at which there is assortative mating, with the original two loci. Cases can be found in which speciation cannot occur. The evolutionary force acting against speciation turns out to be recombination, which acts to randomize the association between the prezygotic isolating mechanism (assortative mating) and the adaptations to the two environments. This model suggests that there is an important distinction between two kinds of speciation. One involves speciation by substitution of the same alleles in the two nascent species, the other by substitution of different alleles. Only in the latter case does recombination act as a force retarding or blocking speciation.},

Shells were examined using light microscopy for anomalous features, which were then documented using scanning electron microscopy. Seven different types of morphological abnormalities and five different surface texture anomalies were observed. Physical abnormalities included profoundly deformed, curled, asymmetrical, and uncoiled shells, irregular suture lines, surface protrusions, and breakage/repair. Textural anomalies observed were surface pits, dissolution features, microborings, microbial biofilms, and the presence of epibionts including bryzoans, cyanobacteria and foraminifers. The same kinds of features were found in this A. angulatus population in both 1982-83 collections and 2006-07 collections. Within-date variability was higher in specimens collected in 1982-83, while between-date variability was higher in 2006-07; overall the range of variability was similar. Given that the site was originally chosen for study because these foraminifers were so abundant, the lack of significant change indicates that the variability of the geochemical habitat is still within the range that A. angulatus can thrive. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

Although theory has shown that local ecosystem size and regional dispersal can determine biodiversity, less is known about the direct and indirect effects of these factors on community stability. Here we show that multitrophic community instability of invertebrates and fishes in coastal ponds is negatively related to local pond size and positively related to distance to the ocean, a proxy for dispersal limitation. Importantly, the effects of pond size and distance on instability were direct rather than indirectly mediated by species richness. This suggests that the diversity–stability relationship is an epiphenomenon whose resolution is neither necessary nor sufficient to understand the stability of these multitrophic communities. Instead, well-established and easily measured local and regional factors historically linked to species richness can be used to predict multitrophic community stability in a variable world.},

Despite reports that adults of some species of lowland tropical trees show clumped distributions (Poore 1968; Ashton 1969), I believe that a third generalization is possible about tropical tree species as contrasted with temperate ones: for most species of lowland tropical trees, adults do not produce new adults in their immediate vicinity (where most seeds fall). Because of this, most adults of a given tree species appear to be more regularly distributed than if the probability of a new adult appearing at a point in the forest were proportional to the number of seeds arriving at that point. This generalization is based on my observa- tions in Central and South American mainland forests, on discussions with foresters familiar with these forests, on discussions with J. H. Connell about Australian rain forests, and on data given in the papers cited above.},

abstract = {Keystone predation can be a determinant of community structure, including species diversity, but factors underlying “keystoneness” have been minimally explored. Using the system in which the original keystone, the sea star Pisaster ochraceus, was discovered, we focused on two potential (but overlapping) determinants of keystoneness: intrinsic traits or state variables of the species (e.g., size, density), and extrinsic environmental parameters (e.g., prey productivity) that may provide conditions favorable for keystone predator evolution. Using a comparative-experimental approach, with repeated field experiments at multiple sites across a variable coastal environment, we tested predation rates, or how quickly predators consumed prey, and predation effects, or community response to predator presence or absence. We tested five hypotheses: (H1) predation rates and effects will vary in space but not time; (H2) per population predation rates will vary primarily with individual traits and population variables; (HJHH3) per capita predation rates will vary only with individual traits; (H4) predation effects will vary with traits, variables, and external drivers; and (H5) as predicted by the keystone predation hypothesis, diversity will vary unimodally with predation pressure. As hypothesized, predation rates differed among sites but not over time (H1), and in caging exclusion experiments, predation effect varied with both intrinsic and extrinsic factors (H4). Unexpectedly, predation rates varied with both intrinsic and extrinsic (H2, per population), or only with extrinsic (H3, per capita) factors. Further, in large-plot exclusion experiments, predation effect was most closely associated with individual traits (contra H4). Finally, taxon diversity varied unimodally with proxies of predation pressure (sessile prey abundance) and was sensitive to extrinsic factors (mussel growth, temperature, and upwelling, H5). Hence, keystoneness depended on predator individual traits, predator population variables, and environmental parameters. However, temporal differences in caging experiments suggested that environmental characteristics underlying prey dynamics may be preeminent. Compared to prior experiments, predation was weaker with low prey input compared to periods with high prey input. Collectively, our results suggest that keystone predator evolution depends on the coalescence of species-specific characteristics, and environmental parameters favoring high prey productivity. Our approach may be a model for future studies exploring the generality of keystoneness.},

Yet, many aspects of Earth's biodiversity are not directly quantified by reflected or emitted photons. Inclusive integration of remote sensing with field-based ecology and evolution is needed to fully understand and preserve Earth's biodiversity. In this Perspective, we argue that multiple data types are necessary for almost all draft targets set by the Convention on Biological Diversity. We examine five key topics in biodiversity science that can be advanced by integrating remote sensing with in situ data collection from field sampling, experiments and laboratory studies to benefit conservation. Lowering the barriers for bringing these approaches together will require global-scale collaboration.},

abstract = {Shallow water tropical coral reefs may bleach due to extremes in a variety of environmental factors. Of particular concern have been temperature, ultraviolet radiation, and photosynthetically available radiation. Satellite observation systems allow synoptic-scale monitoring of coral environments that can be used to investigate the effects of such environmental parameters. Recent advancements in algorithm development for new satellite data products have made it possible to include light availability in such monitoring. Long-term satellite data (2000–2013), in combination with in situ bleaching surveys (N = 3,334; spanning 2003–2012), were used to identify the environmental factors contributing to bleaching of Florida reef tract corals. Stepwise multiple linear regression supports the conclusion that elevated sea surface temperature (SST; partial R adj 2 = 0.13; p < 0.001) and high visible light levels reaching the benthos (partial R adj 2 = 0.06; p < 0.001) each independently contributed to coral bleaching. The effect of SST was modulated by significant interactions with wind speed (partial R adj 2 = 0.03; p < 0.001) and ultraviolet benthic available light (partial R adj 2 = 0.01; p = 0.022). These relationships were combined via canonical analysis of principal coordinates to create a predictive model of coral reef bleaching for the region. This model predicted ‘severe bleaching' and ‘no bleaching' conditions with 69 and 57 % classification success, respectively. This was approximately 2.5 times greater than that predicted by chance and shows improvement over similar models created using only temperature data. The results enhance the understanding of the factors contributing to coral bleaching and allow for weekly assessment of historical and current bleaching stress.},

abstract = {Populations and communities fluctuate in their overall numbers through time, and the magnitude of fluctuations in individual species may scale to communities. However, the composite variability at the community scale is expected to be tempered by opposing fluctuations in individual populations, a phenomenon often called the portfolio effect. Understanding population variability, how it scales to community variability, and the spatial scaling in this variability are pressing needs given shifting environmental conditions and community composition. We explore evidence for portfolio effects using null community simulations and a large collection of empirical community time series from the BioTIME database. Additionally, we explore the relative roles of habitat type and geographic location on population and community temporal variability. We find strong portfolio effects in our theoretical community model, but weak effects in empirical data, suggesting a role for shared environmental responses, interspecific competition, or a litany of other factors. Furthermore, we observe a clear latitudinal signal – and differences among habitat types – in population and community variability. Together, this highlights the need to develop realistic models of community dynamics, and hints at spatial, and underlying environmental, gradients in variability in both population and community dynamics.},

abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an "observer" of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging from the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

abstract = {Climate change is driving changes in the physical and chemical properties of the ocean that have consequences for marine ecosystems. Here, we review evidence for the responses of marine life to recent climate change across ocean regions, from tropical seas to polar oceans. We consider observed changes in calcification rates, demography, abundance, distribution, and phenology of marine species. We draw on a database of observed climate change impacts on marine species, supplemented with evidence in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We discuss factors that limit or facilitate species' responses, such as fishing pressure, the availability of prey, habitat, light and other resources, and dispersal by ocean currents. We find that general trends in species' responses are consistent with expectations from climate change, including shifts in distribution to higher latitudes and to deeper locations, advances in spring phenology, declines in calcification, and increases in the abundance of warm-water species. The volume and type of evidence associated with species responses to climate change is variable across ocean regions and taxonomic groups, with predominance of evidence derived from the heavily-studied north Atlantic Ocean. Most investigations of the impact of climate change being associated with the impacts of changing temperature, with few observations of effects of changing oxygen, wave climate, precipitation (coastal waters), or ocean acidification. Observations of species responses that have been linked to anthropogenic climate change are widespread, but are still lacking for some taxonomic groups (e.g., phytoplankton, benthic invertebrates, marine mammals).},

Despite a substantial overlap in diet, ordination of ingested prey items clustered samples into distinctive species groupings, reflective of the foraging gradient among species. Orthopristis chrysoptera displayed the lowest overall frequency of microplastic ingestion and the most distinctive ordination grouping, indicating their selective invertebrate foraging preferences. Cluster analysis of O. chrysoptera most closely classified microplastic with the ingestion of benthic invertebrates, whereas the ingestion of microplastic by all other species most closely classified with the ingestion of vegetation and shrimp.

Currently, a single species of Bryde's whale, Balaenoptera edeni Anderson, 1879, is recognized, with two subspecies, Eden's whale, B. edeni edeni and Bryde's whale, B. edeni brydei (Olsen, 1913), although some authors have recognized these as separate species. Recently, a new, evolutionarily divergent lineage of Bryde's-like whale was identified based on genetic data and was found to be restricted primarily to the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOMx). Here, we provide the first morphological examination of a complete skull from these whales and identify diagnostic characters that distinguish it from the other medium-sized baleen whale taxa. In addition, we have increased the number of genetic samples of these Bryde's-like whales in the GOMx from 23 to 36 individuals, all of which matched the GOMx lineage. A review of Bryde's-like whale records in the Caribbean and greater Atlantic supports an isolated distribution for this unique lineage, augmenting the genetic and morphological body of evidence supporting the existence of an undescribed species of Balaenoptera from the Gulf of Mexico.},

With ongoing climate change, extreme climatic events are predicted to become more frequent and severe globally, impacting crop production. The whole process of farming will become more uncertain, from choice of crop and crop productivity to the timing of the windows of opportunity for management decisions. Future agricultural policies, therefore, should not only consider changes in grassland production, but also its future stability. We use a case study of agricultural pastures on the island of Ireland to project different components of ecosystem stability (resistance, recovery time and recovery rate) to 2050 and 2080 under different future climate scenarios: a peak and decline scenario; and a continued emissions scenario. We show that future climate change will have substantial effects on both the future resistance and the recovery of ecosystem functioning following environmental disturbances, but the spatial pattern of effect sizes is not the same for these two measures of stability. National level analyses and agricultural policies, therefore, are likely to ignore regional variation in future change. From this, we encourage the translation of stability-based constructs, as well as maximum yield considerations, into future agricultural policy at the regional level.},

abstract = {The impact of anthropogenic climate change on terrestrial organisms is often predicted to increase with latitude, in parallel with the rate of warming. Yet the biological impact of rising temperatures also depends on the physiological sensitivity of organisms to temperature change. We integrate empirical fitness curves describing the thermal tolerance of terrestrial insects from around the world with the projected geographic distribution of climate change for the next century to estimate the direct impact of warming on insect fitness across latitude. The results show that warming in the tropics, although relatively small in magnitude, is likely to have the most deleterious consequences because tropical insects are relatively sensitive to temperature change and are currently living very close to their optimal temperature. In contrast, species at higher latitudes have broader thermal tolerance and are living in climates that are currently cooler than their physiological optima, so that warming may even enhance their fitness. Available thermal tolerance data for several vertebrate taxa exhibit similar patterns, suggesting that these results are general for terrestrial ectotherms. Our analyses imply that, in the absence of ameliorating factors such as migration and adaptation, the greatest extinction risks from global warming may be in the tropics, where biological diversity is also greatest. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

However, recent progress towards a theoretical synthesis now provides a guiding framework for organizing and integrating all primary data and methods for spatiotemporal assemblage-level inference in ecology. In this paper, we describe how recent theoretical developments can provide an organizing paradigm for linking advances in data collection and methodological frameworks across disparate ecological sub-disciplines and across large spatial and temporal scales. First, we summarize the set of fundamental processes that determine change in multispecies assemblages across spatial and temporal scales by reviewing recent theoretical syntheses of community ecology. Second, we review recent advances in data and methods across the main sub-disciplines concerned with ecological inference across large spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales, and organize them based on the primary fundamental processes they include, rather than the spatiotemporal scale of their inferences. Finally, we highlight how iteratively focusing on only one fundamental process at a time, but combining all relevant spatiotemporal data and methods, may reduce the conceptual challenges to integration among ecological sub-disciplines. Moreover, we discuss a number of avenues for decreasing the practical barriers to integration among data and methods. We aim to reconcile the recent convergence of decades of thinking in community ecology and macroecology theory with the rapid progress in spatiotemporal approaches for assemblage-level inference, at a time where a robust understanding of spatiotemporal change in ecological assemblages is more crucial than ever to conserve biodiversity.},

abstract = {Increasing temperatures associated with climate change may generate phenological mismatches that disrupt previously synchronous trophic interactions. Most work on mismatch has focused on temporal trends, whereas spatial variation in the degree of trophic synchrony has largely been neglected, even though the degree to which mismatch varies in space has implications for meso-scale population dynamics and evolution. Here we quantify latitudinal trends in phenological mismatch, using phenological data on an oak-caterpillar-bird system from across the UK. Increasing latitude delays phenology of all species, but more so for oak, resulting in a shorter interval between leaf emergence and peak caterpillar biomass at northern locations. Asynchrony found between peak caterpillar biomass and peak nestling demand of blue tits, great tits and pied flycatchers increases in earlier (warm) springs. There is no evidence of spatial variation in the timing of peak nestling demand relative to peak caterpillar biomass for any species. Phenological mismatch alone is thus unlikely to explain spatial variation in population trends. Given projections of continued spring warming, we predict that temperate forest birds will become increasingly mismatched with peak caterpillar timing. Latitudinal invariance in the direction of mismatch may act as a double-edged sword that presents no opportunities for spatial buffering from the effects of mismatch on population size, but generates spatially consistent directional selection on timing, which could facilitate rapid evolutionary change.},

abstract = {The metacommunity framework has been readily applied to coastal benthic marine environments to examine how larval dispersal affects the dynamics of patchily distributed communities. Transitioning to a meta-ecosystem perspective requires knowledge of interactions between living and non-living compartments occurring across scales in these environments. Here, we synthesize and analyze evidence of non-living resource flows in coastal benthic marine environments. Our objectives are to establish the types of benthic ecosystems that are coupled by resource flows, the spatial scale and directionality of the couplings, and the magnitude of resulting subsidization of recipient organisms. We find that resource flows commonly couple different types of coastal benthic ecosystems and can occur bidirectionally between ecosystems. Our quantitative synthesis yields a frequency distribution of resource flow distance, which suggests they frequently couple ecosystems across smaller distances than larval dispersal and that the probability of resource flows coupling benthic ecosystems decreases exponentially with distance between ecosystems. The magnitude of subsidization of recipient organisms also decreases with distance from the source of the resource flow. Our findings reveal that considering ecosystem heterogeneity and the respective scales of different types of spatial flows will be an important component of extending the marine metacommunity framework to meta-ecosystems. We propose an avenue for integrating ecosystem heterogeneity into meta-ecosystem theory, based upon general differences in functioning across coupled ecosystems revealed by our synthesis, and we argue for the development of a hierarchical meta-ecosystem theory.},

abstract = {Using a high resolution, three-dimensional, primitive equation, finite volume coastal ocean model with flooding and drying capabilities, supported by a merged bathymetric-topographic data set and driven by prototypical hurricane winds and atmospheric pressure fields, we investigated the storm surge responses for the Tampa Bay, Florida, vicinity and their sensitivities to point of landfall, direction and speed of approach, and intensity. All of these factors were found to be important. Flooding potential by wind stress and atmospheric pressure induced surge is significant for a category 2 hurricane and catastrophic for a category 4 hurricane. Tide, river, and wave effects are additive, making the potential for flood-induced damage even greater. Since storm surge sets up as a slope to the sea surface, the highest surge tends to occur over the upper reaches of the bay, Old Tampa Bay and Hillsborough Bay in particular. For point of landfall sensitivity, the worst case is when the hurricane center is positioned north of the bay mouth such that the maximum winds associated with the eye wall are at the bay mouth. Northerly (southerly) approaching storms yield larger (smaller) surges since the winds initially set up (set down) water level. As a hybrid between the landfall and direction sensitivity experiments, a storm transiting up the bay axis from southwest to northeast yields the smallest surge, debunking a misconception that this is the worst Tampa Bay flooding case. Hurricanes with slow (fast) translation speeds yield larger (smaller) surges within Tampa Bay due to the time required to redistribute mass.},

@article{Ospina-Alvarez2008,
abstract = {Background: In gonochoristic vertebrates, sex determination mechanisms can be classified as genotypic (GSD) or temperature-dependent (TSD). Some cases of TSD in fish have been questioned, but the prevalent view is that TSD is very common in this group of animals, with three different response patterns to temperature. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed field and laboratory data for the 59 fish species where TSD has been explicitly or implicitly claimed so far. For each species, we compiled data on the presence or absence of sex chromosomes and determined if the sex ratio response was obtained within temperatures that the species experiences in the wild. If so, we studied whether this response was statistically significant. We found evidence that many cases of observed sex ratio shifts in response to temperature reveal thermal alterations of an otherwise predominately GSD mechanism rather than the presence of TSD. We also show that in those fish species that actually have TSD, sex ratio response to increasing temperatures invariably results in highly male-biased sex ratios, and that even small changes of just 1-2°C can significantly alter the sex ratio from 1:1 (males:females) up to 3:1 in both freshwater and marine species. Conclusions/Significance: We demonstrate that TSD in fish is far less widespread than currently believed, suggesting that TSD is clearly the exception in fish sex determination. Further, species with TSD exhibit only one general sex ratio response pattern to temperature. However, the viability of some fish populations with TSD can be compromised through alterations in their sex ratios as a response to temperature fluctuations of the magnitude predicted by climate change. {\textcopyright} 2008 Ospina-{\'{A}}lvarez, Piferrer.},

abstract = {Over the last three decades corals have declined precipitously in the Florida Keys. Their population decline has prompted restoration effort. Yet, little effort has been invested in understanding the contemporary niche spaces of coral species, which could assist in prioritizing conservation habitats. We sought to predict the probability of occurrence of 23 coral species, including the critically endangered Acropora cervicornis, using observations at 985 sites from 2011-2015. We ran boosted regression trees to evaluate the relationship between the presence of these corals and eight potential environmental predictors: (i) bathymetry (m), (ii) mean of daily sea surface temperature (SST) (°C), (iii) variance of SST (°C), (iv) range of SST (°C), (v) chlorophyll-a concentration (mg m3), (vi) turbidity (m-1), (vii) wave energy (kJ m-2), and (viii) distance from coast (km). The Marquesas and the lower and upper Florida Keys were predicted to support the most suitable habitats for the 23 coral species examined. A. cervicornis had one of the smallest areas of suitable habitat, which was limited to the lower and upper Florida Keys, the Dry Tortugas, and nearshore Broward-Miami reefs. The best environmental predictors of site occupancy of A. cervicornis were SST range (4-5°C) and turbidity (K490 between 0.15-0.25 m-1). Historically A. cervicornis was reported in clear oligotrophic waters, although the present results find the coral species surviving in nearshore turbid conditions. Nearshore, turbid reefs may shade corals during high-temperature events, and therefore nearshore reefs in south Florida may become important refuges for corals as the ocean temperatures continue to increase.},

abstract = {Context: Ecotones are boundary zones formed where overlap between neighboring ecosystems creates an intermediate ecosystem with unique ecological characteristics. Dynamic ecotones change position along a boundary over time and can be further categorized as either shifting, where the adjacent ecosystems alternatively drive movement of the ecotone but maintain the same relative location over time, or directional, where one system encroaches into the other and the ecotone moves laterally. Objectives: The purpose of this work was to examine how climate change alters movement dynamics of both directional and shifting ecotones. Methods: In three ecosystem case studies, we examine the effects of climate change on landscape-scale ecotone movement across the marine, terrestrial, and interfacing environments. Results: Shifts in local and global climate drive changes in ecotone patterns, increasing directional ecotone movement at both shifting and directional ecotones. Specifically, unidirectional changes in climate patterns disrupt dynamic equilibria at shifting ecosystem boundaries, thereby facilitating unidirectional movement at the previously shifting boundaries. Climate changes additionally accelerate pre-existing directional migration of ecotones through changes to abiotic gradients. Conclusion: Directional climate change increases directional movement in multiple types of ecotone. Future work should consider the rate and feedback mechanisms of ecotone movement and function at additional ecotones.},

abstract = {In freshwater ecosystems, habitat alteration contributes directly to biodiversity loss. Dragonflies are sentinel species that are key invertebrate predators in both aquatic (as larvae) and terrestrial ecosystems (as adults). Understanding the habitat factors affecting dragonfly emergence can inform management practices to conserve habitats supporting these species and the functions they perform. Transitioning from larvae to adults, dragonflies leave behind larval exoskeletons (exuviae), which reveal information about the emergent population without the need for sacrificing living organisms. Capitalizing on Atlantic Canada's largest freshwater wetland, the Grand Lake Meadows (GLM) and the associated Saint John/Wolastoq River (SJWR), we studied the spatial (i.e., across the mainstem, tributary, and wetland sites) and temporal (across 3 years) variation in assemblages of emergent dragonflies (Anisoptera) and assessed the relative contribution of aquatic and terrestrial factors structuring these assemblages. The GLM complex, including the lotic SJWR and its tributaries and associated lentic wetlands, provided a range of riparian and aquatic habitat variability ideal for studying dragonfly emergence patterns across a relatively homogenous climatic region. Emergent dragonfly responses were associated with spatial, but not temporal, variation. Additionally, dragonfly communities were associated with both aquatic and terrestrial factors, while diversity was primarily associated with terrestrial factors. Specific terrestrial factors associated with the emergence of the dragonfly community included canopy cover and slope, while aquatic factors included water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and baseflow. Our results indicate that management of river habitats for dragonfly conservation should incorporate riparian habitat protection while maintaining aquatic habitat and habitat quality.},

abstract = {Warmer temperatures are accelerating the phenology of organisms around the world. Temperature sensitivity of phenology might be greater in colder, higher latitude sites than in warmer regions, in part because small changes in temperature constitute greater relative changes in thermal balance at colder sites. To test this hypothesis, we examined up to 20 years of phenology data for 47 tundra plant species at 18 high-latitude sites along a climatic gradient. Across all species, the timing of leaf emergence and flowering was more sensitive to a given increase in summer temperature at colder than warmer high-latitude locations. A similar pattern was seen over time for the flowering phenology of a widespread species, Cassiope tetragona. These are among the first results highlighting differential phenological responses of plants across a climatic gradient and suggest the possibility of convergence in flowering times and therefore an increase in gene flow across latitudes as the climate warms.},

abstract = {Life-history traits are promising tools to predict species commonness and rarity because they influence a population's fitness in a given environment. Yet, species with similar traits can have vastly different abundances, challenging the prospect of robust trait-based predictions. Using long-term demographic monitoring, we show that coral populations with similar morphological and life-history traits show persistent (decade-long) differences in abundance. Morphological groups predicted species positions along two, well known life-history axes (the fast-slow continuum and size-specific fecundity). However, integral projection models revealed that density-independent population growth ($\lambda$) was more variable within morphological groups, and was consistently higher in dominant species relative to rare species. Within-group $\lambda$ differences projected large abundance differences among similar species in short timeframes, and were generated by small but compounding variation in growth, survival, and reproduction. Our study shows that easily measured morphological traits predict demographic strategies, yet small life-history differences can accumulate into large differences in $\lambda$ and abundance among similar species. Quantifying the net effects of multiple traits on population dynamics is therefore essential to anticipate species commonness and rarity.},

We show that while metabolic adjustment may assist Australasian kelp beds to persist and maintain abundance in warmer waters, it also reduces the physiological responsiveness of kelps to perturbation, and suppresses canopy recovery from disturbances by reducing the ecological performance of kelp recruits. This provides a warning not to rely solely on inventories of distribution and abundance to evaluate ecosystem function. The erosion of resilience is mediated by a shift in adult-juvenile interactions from competitive under cool to facilitative under warm conditions, supporting the prediction that positive interactions may become increasingly important in a warmer future. Kelp beds may remain intact but with a lower threshold for where additional impacts (e.g., extreme storms or reduced water quality) will lead to persistent loss of habitat and ecological function. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

In theory, multispecies assemblages can persist if species use shared resources at different times, thereby minimizing interspecific competition. However, there is scant empirical evidence supporting these predictions and, to the best of our knowledge, seasonal variation has never been explored in the context of fluctuation-mediated coexistence.Results: Using an exceptionally well-documented estuarine fish assemblage, sampled monthly for over 30 years, we show that temporal shifts in species abundances underpin species coexistence. Species fall into distinct seasonal groups, within which spatial resource use is more heterogeneous than would be expected by chance at those times when competition for food is most intense. We also detect seasonal variation in the richness and evenness of the community, again linked to shifts in resource availability.Conclusions: These results reveal that spatiotemporal shifts in community composition minimize competitive interactions and help stabilize total abundance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Shimadzu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Invasive species often exacerbate global and local stresses on ecosystems, with animal invaders commonly experiencing a release from enemies, including predators. Release from predation helps explain the lionfish (Pterois volitans/. miles) invasion of the western Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, although the extent of biological control exerted by native predators is a topic of debate centered on the interpretation of spatial distributions of lionfish and those predators. In many places, control of lionfish numbers relies on people acting as predators via organized culls. In some cases, the resulting dead or injured lionfish are eaten by sharks and groupers, which may condition these na{\"{i}}ve, native predators. This study complements existing field surveys by assessing the potential for predation on invasive lionfish at Little Cayman Island, BWI with tethering experiments. We tethered 132 live lionfish (52-220. mm total length) in three different habitats: seagrass beds, rarely culled reefs, and intensely culled reefs. Binary logistic regression indicated that, across all habitats and the size range tested, the potential for predation increased slightly (1.02. ×) but significantly with 1. mm increases in total length. In addition, lionfish tethered on intensely culled reefs were approximately 30. × and 14. × more likely to be taken by piscivores than fish tethered in seagrass or on rarely culled reefs. Overall, results suggested that native predators were capable of consuming healthy, tethered lionfish off Little Cayman Island and the na{\"{i}}vet{\'{e}} of native predators was overcome by conditioning. Of course, conditioning designed to increase predation on lionfish, augment culling, and help control the invasion must be implemented without endangering people. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Metacommunity approaches are becoming popular when analyzing factors driving species distribution at the regional scale. However, until the popularization of the variation partitioning technique it was difficult to assess the main drivers of the observed patterns (spatial or environmental). Here we propose a new framework linking the emergence of different metacommunity structures (e.g., nested, Gleasonian, Clementsian) to spatial and environmental filters. This is a novel approach that provides a more profound analysis of how both drivers could lead to similar metacommunity structures. We tested this framework on 110 sites covering a strong environmental gradient (i.e., microcrustacean assemblages organized along a salinity gradient, from freshwater to brackish water wetlands). First we identified the metacommunity structure that better fitted these microcrustacean assemblages. Then, we used hierarchical variation partitioning to quantify the relative influences of environmental filters and the distance among wetlands on the identified structure. Our results showed that under strong environmental filtering metacommunity structures were non-random. We also noted that even passive dispersers, that are supposed to be poorly spatially filtered, showed spatial signals at a large geographical scale. However, some difficulties arose when inferring biotic interactions at finer-scale spatial signals. Overall, our study shows the potential of elements of metacommunity structure combined with variation partition techniques to detect environmental drivers and broadscale patterns of metacommunity structure, and that some caution is needed when interpreting finer-scale spatial signals.},

@article{Grime1998,
abstract = {[1 It is useful to distinguish between the immediate effects of species richness on ecosystems and those which become apparent on a longer time scale, described here as filter and founder effects. 2 Relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties can be explored by classifying component species into three categories - dominants, subordinates and transients. Dominants recur in particular vegetation types, are relatively large, exhibit coarse-grained foraging for resources and, as individual species, make a substantial contribution to the plant biomass. Subordinates also show high fidelity of association with particular vegetation types but they are smaller in stature, forage on a more restricted scale and tend to occupy microhabitats delimited by the architecture and phenology of their associated dominants. Transients comprise a heterogeneous assortment of species of low abundance and persistence; a high proportion are juveniles of species that occur as dominants or subordinates in neighbouring ecosystems. 3 A `mass ratio' theory proposes that immediate controls are in proportion to inputs to primary production, are determined to an overwhelming extent by the traits and functional diversity of the dominant plants and are relatively insensitive to the richness of subordinates and transients. Recent experiments support the mass ratio hypothesis and the conclusion of Huston (1997) that claims of immediate benefits of high species richness to ecosystem functions arise from misinterpretation of data. 4 Attribution of immediate control to dominants does not exclude subordinates and transients from involvement in the determination of ecosystem function and sustainability. Both are suspected to play a crucial, if intermittent, role by influencing the recruitment of dominants. Some subordinates may act as a filter influencing regeneration by dominants following major perturbations. 5 Transients originate from the seed rain and seed banks and provide an index of the pool of potential dominants and subordinates at specific sites. Where the landscape carousel operates against a background of declining diversity in the reservoir of colonizing transients, we may predict that a progressive loss of ecosystem functions will arise from the decline in the precision with which dominants can engage in the re-assembly and relocation of ecosystems.]},

abstract = {During the last three decades, Bayesian methods have developed greatly in the field of epidemiology. Their main challenge focusses around computation, but the advent of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) and in particular of the WinBUGS software has opened the doors of Bayesian modelling to the wide research community. However model complexity and database dimension still remain a constraint.Recently the use of Gaussian random fields has become increasingly popular in epidemiology as very often epidemiological data are characterised by a spatial and/or temporal structure which needs to be taken into account in the inferential process. The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach has been developed as a computationally efficient alternative to MCMC and the availability of an R package (R-INLA) allows researchers to easily apply this method.In this paper we review the INLA approach and present some applications on spatial and spatio-temporal data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms.

abstract = {In many academic fields, the number of papers published each year has increased significantly over time. Policy measures aim to increase the quantity of scientists, research funding, and scientific output, which is measured by the number of papers produced. These quantitative metrics determine the career trajectories of scholars and evaluations of academic departments, institutions, and nations. Whether and how these increases in the numbers of scientists and papers translate into advances in knowledge is unclear, however. Here, we first lay out a theoretical argument for why too many papers published each year in a field can lead to stagnation rather than advance. The deluge of new papers may deprive reviewers and readers the cognitive slack required to fully recognize and understand novel ideas. Competition among many new ideas may prevent the gradual accumulation of focused attention on a promising new idea. Then, we show data supporting the predictions of this theory. When the number of papers published per year in a scientific field grows large, citations flow disproportionately to already well-cited papers; the list of most-cited papers ossifies; new papers are unlikely to ever become highly cited, and when they do, it is not through a gradual, cumulative process of attention gathering; and newly published papers become unlikely to disrupt existing work. These findings suggest that the progress of large scientific fields may be slowed, trapped in existing canon. Policy measures shifting how scientific work is produced, disseminated, consumed, and rewarded may be called for to push fields into new, more fertile areas of study.},

@article{Stearns1976,
abstract = {This review organizes ideas on the evolution of life histories. The key life-history traits are brood size, size of young, the age distribution of reproductive effort, the interaction of reproductive effort with adutl mortality, and the variation in these traits among an individual's progeny. The general theoretical problem is to predict which combinations of traits will evolve in organisms living in specified circumstances. First consider single traits. Theorists have made the following predictions: (1) Where adult exceeds juvenile mortality, the organism should reproduce only once in its lifetime. Where juvenile exceeds adult mortality, the organism should reproduce several times. (2) Brood size should maximize the number of young surviving to maturity, summed over the lifetime of the parent. But when optimum brood-size varies unpredictably in time, smaller broods should be favored because they decrease the chances of total failure on a given attempt. (3) In expanding populations, selection should minimize age at maturity. In stable populations, when reproductive success depends on size, age, or social status, or when adult exceeds juvenile mortality, then maturation should be delayed, as it should be in declining populations. (4) Young should increase in size at birth with increased predation risk, and decrease in size with increased resource availability. Theorists have also predicted that only particular combinations of traits should occur in specified circumstances. (5) In growing populations, age at maturity should be minimized, reproductive effort concentrated early in life, and brood size increased. (6) One view holds that in stable environments, late maturity, multiple broods, a few, large young, parental care, and small reproductive efforts should be favored (K-selection). In fluctuating environments, early maturity, many small young, reduced parental care, and large reproductive efforts should be favored (r-selection). (7) But another view holds that when juvenile mortality fluctuates more than adult mortality, the traits associated with stable and fluctuating environments should be reversed. We need experiments that test the assumptions and predictions reviewed here, more comprehensive theory that makes more readily falsifiable predictions, and examination of different definitions of fitness.},

abstract = {A numerical circulation model, quantitatively assessed against in situ observations, is used to describe the circulation on the West Florida Continental Shelf during spring 2007 when pre-settlement gag (Mycteroperca microlepis) were present in the surf zone near Tampa Bay, Florida. The pre-settlement fish were found to be isotopically distinct from settled juveniles in the area, which is consistent with recent arrival at near shore nursery habitats from offshore spawning grounds. Simulated particle trajectories are employed to test hypotheses relating to either a surface or a near-bottom route of across-shelf transport. The surface-route hypothesis is rejected, whereas the bottom-route hypothesis is found to be consistent with the location of pre-settlement fish and their co-occurrence with macroalgae of offshore, hard-bottom origin. We conclude that gag larvae are transported to the near shore via the bottom Ekman layer and that such transport is facilitated by remote forcing associated with Gulf of Mexico Loop Current interactions with the shelf slope near the Dry Tortugas. Being that such remote forcing occurs inter-annually and not always in phase with the preferred spawning months (late winter through early spring), gag recruitment success should similarly vary with year and location. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Valuable biological information can be obtained by monitoring the movement of organisms. However, the choice of monitoring method becomes highly restricted when following small organisms (<100 mm), especially in aquatic ecosystems. Stable isotopes are being increasingly used in this respect but rarely at the local spatial scale, i. e. 10-1000 s of metres. We sought to identify movement of small fishes between a main river channel and its tributary. Little overlap in isotope baseline was detected between the two channels despite some temporal variability in $\delta$15N of baseline indicator organisms in the main river. The individuals of two small cyprinid fish species (Leuciscus souffia and Alburnoides bipunctatus) of all the size classes (40-100 mm) caught within the tributary showed considerable heterogeneity in $\delta$15N values. Classification and discriminant analysis on isotope-derived data distinguished two significantly different groups. Moreover, this result was supported by further sampling of fish caught in the main river (in May and December 2006). Alternative hypotheses, such as dietary differences, biological factors, temporal shifts and spatial differences in diet, did not explain $\delta$15N variability. This application of stable isotopes at a relatively small spatial and temporal scales further demonstrates its potential as a tool for ecologists. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

@article{Raventos2021,
abstract = {As species struggle to cope with rising ocean temperatures, temperate marine assemblages are facing major reorganization. Many benthic species have a brief but critical period dispersing through the plankton, when they are particularly susceptible to variations in temperature. Impacts of rising temperatures can thus ripple through the population with community-wide consequences. However, responses are highly species-specific, making it difficult to discern assemblage-wide patterns in the life histories of different fish species. Here, we evaluate the responses to temperature in the early life histories of several fish species using otolith reconstructive techniques. We also assess the consequences of future warming scenarios to this assemblage. We sampled recent settlers of nine common species across a temperature gradient in the Mediterranean Sea and obtained environmental data for each individual. Using otolith microstructure, we measured early life traits including pelagic larval duration (PLD), growth rate, settlement size, hatching and settlement dates. We used a GLM framework to examine how environmental variables influenced early life-history parameters. We show that increasing temperature results in considerable reduction in the dispersal potential of temperate fish. We find a nearly universal, assemblage-wide decline in pelagic larval duration (PLD) of between 10% and 25%. This was because, with increasing temperature, larvae grew quicker to their settlement size. Settlement size itself was less affected by temperature and appears to be an ontogenetically fixed process. Given current estimates of ocean warming, there could be an assemblage-wide reduction in larval dispersal of up to 50 km across the Mediterranean, reducing connectivity and potentially isolating populations as waters warm.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Although the strengths of the technique for providing high-resolution structural and analytical information have been known and understood for much longer than that, the key to its more recent popularity has undoubtedly been the availability of STEM modes on instruments available from the major TEM manufacturers. Gone are the days when researchers want- ing the unique capabilities of high-resolution STEM had to undertake the task of keeping a VG dedicated STEM instrument operating. Given the current interest in the technique, we felt that the time was right to review the current state of knowledge about STEM and STEM-related techniques and their application to a range of materials problems. The purpose of this volume is both to educate those who wish to deepen their understanding of STEM and to inform those who are seeking a review of the latest applications and methods associated with STEM. We are delighted that so many of our colleagues accepted our invitation to contribute to this volume, and we are indebted to them for their efforts in creating such excellent contributions. The follow- ing chapters illustrate how close STEM has brought us to the ultimate materials characterisation challenge of analysing materials atom by atom. We hope that the following chapters demonstrate the spectacular results that can be achieved when performing the relatively simple experiment of focusing a beam of electrons down to an atomic scale and measuring the scattering that results.

abstract = {Atlantic tarpon Megalops atlanticus are important mesopredators in the western Atlantic Ocean, and the focus of a popular recreational fishery that targets them throughout their annual migration in the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern USA. Using 4 years of acoustic telemetry data, we quantified the seasonal variation in phenology of arrival and departure, and occupancy for subadult and adult M. atlanticus in the Florida Keys, USA. While detection profiles of subadult M. atlanticus (n = 11) varied in residency and dispersal patterns, all adult M. atlanticus detection profiles (n = 47) exhibited seasonal residency. The median spring-summer residence period of adult M. atlanticus ranged from 40 to 60 d, with a mean of 51 d across years. At the individual level, repeatability in the timing of arrival and duration were high across years, suggesting that photoperiod may be an important migratory cue. Further, the repeatability in the timing of arrival to the Florida Keys for individuals was not associated with sea surface temperature (SST). At the population level, residency corresponded with the spawning season, with the majority of adult M. atlanticus arriving in April once SST reached 26°C, and then departing in June (27-29°C). Highest occupancy probabilities for adult M. atlanticus occurred in May (26-28°C) and lowest between August and October. Large aggregations of M. atlanticus that occur during the spawning season (April-June) are potentially vulnerable to the effects of habitat degradation and angling-related mortality and behavioral changes. These data on M. atlanticus phenology provide insights for implementing science-based strategic management plans.},

abstract = {1. This paper describes a novel approach to modelling of metapopulation dynamics. The model is constructed as a generalized incidence function, which describes how the fraction of occupied habitat patches depends on patch areas and isolations. 2. The model may be fitted to presence/absence data from a metapopulation at a dynamic equilibrium between extinctions and colonizations. 3. Using the estimated parameter values, transient dynamics and the equilibrium fraction of occupied patches in any system of habitat patches can be predicted. The significance of particular habitat patches for the long-term persistence of the metapopulation, for example, can also be evaluated. 4. The model is fitted to data from three butterfly metapopulations. The model predicts well the observed minimum patch size for occupancy and the numbers of extinctions and colonizations per year (turnover rate). The results suggest that local populations of the three butterflies in patches of 1 ha, which may support of the order of 1000 adult butterflies, have an expected lifetime of 20-100 years.},

abstract = {In metacommunity ecology, a major focus has been on combining observational and analytical approaches to identify the role of critical assembly processes, such as dispersal limitation and environmental filtering, but this work has largely ignored temporal community dynamics. Here, we develop a “virtual ecologist” approach to evaluate assembly processes by simulating metacommunities varying in three main processes: density-independent responses to abiotic conditions, density-dependent biotic interactions, and dispersal. We then calculate a number of commonly used summary statistics of community structure in space and time and use random forests to evaluate their utility for inferring the strength of these three processes. We find that (i) both spatial and temporal data are necessary to disentangle metacommunity processes based on the summary statistics we test, and including statistics that are measured through time increases the explanatory power of random forests by up to 59% compared to cases where only spatial variation is considered; (ii) the three studied processes can be distinguished with different descriptors; and (iii) each summary statistic is differently sensitive to temporal and spatial sampling effort. Including repeated observations of metacommunities over time was essential for inferring the metacommunity processes, particularly dispersal. Some of the most useful statistics include the coefficient of variation of species abundances through time and metrics that incorporate variation in the relative abundances (evenness) of species. We conclude that a combination of methods and summary statistics is probably necessary to understand the processes that underlie metacommunity assembly through space and time, but we recognize that these results will be modified when other processes or summary statistics are used.},

abstract = {Ecosystem modifiers have the ability to significantly alter the ecosystem they inhabit sometimes with serious consequences for their own populations. We evaluated the ability of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) to modify seagrass ecosystems by their foraging activity. This study was conducted in a seagrass-dominated lagoon in the Lakshadweep Islands, Indian Ocean, where a stable high-density congregation of green turtles is present. We determined a gradient of turtle density in the lagoon and measured the intensity of turtle herbivory across the gradient. We then measured the impact of increasing grazing on seagrass structural parameters, growth and flowering along this gradient. Our results indicate that turtles substantially change seagrass meadow structure (canopy height, shoot length, width and density), reduce flowering and can potentially even cause changes in the species composition of the meadow. We discuss the implications of these results for seagrass ecosystem function, green turtle movement and human attitudes. When conserving ecosystem modifiers like the green turtle, any management strategy needs to include a detailed knowledge of the roles these species play in the ecosystems they inhabit. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Legendre2019,
abstract = {Aim: This paper presents the statistical bases for temporal beta-diversity analysis, a method to study changes in community composition through time from repeated surveys at several sites. Surveys of that type are presently done by ecologists around the world. A temporal beta-diversity Index (TBI) is computed for each site, measuring the change in species composition between the first (T1) and second surveys (T2). TBI indices can be decomposed into losses and gains; they can also be tested for significance, allowing one to identify the sites that have changed in composition in exceptional ways. This method will be of value to identify exceptional sites in space–time surveys carried out to study anthropogenic impacts, including climate change. Innovation: The null hypothesis of the TBI test is that a species assemblage is not exceptionally different between T1 and T2, compared to assemblages that could have been observed at this site at T1 and T2 under conditions corresponding to H 0 . Tests of significance of coefficients in a dissimilarity matrix are usually not possible because the values in the matrix are interrelated. Here, however, the dissimilarity between T1 and T2 for a site is computed with different data from the dissimilarities used for the T1–T2 comparison at other sites. It is thus possible to compute a valid test of significance in that case. In addition, the paper shows how TBI dissimilarities can be decomposed into loss and gain components (of species, or abundances-per-species) and how a B–C plot can be produced from these components, which informs users about the processes of biodiversity losses and gains through time in space–time survey data. Main conclusion: Three applications of the method to different ecological communities are presented. This method is applicable worldwide to all types of communities, marine, and terrestrial. R software is available implementing the method.},

abstract = {1. Soils are one of the last great frontiers for biodiversity research and are home to an extraordinary range of microbial and animal groups. Biological activities in soils drive many of the key ecosystem processes that govern the global system, especially in the cycling of elements such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. 2. We cannot currently make firm statements about the scale of biodiversity in soils, or about the roles played by soil organisms in the transformations of organic materials that underlie those cycles. The recent UK Soil Biodiversity Programme (SBP) has brought a unique concentration of researchers to bear on a single soil in Scotland, and has generated a large amount of data concerning biodiversity, carbon flux and resilience in the soil ecosystem. 3. One of the key discoveries of the SBP was the extreme diversity of small organisms: researchers in the programme identified over 100 species of bacteria, 350 protozoa, 140 nematodes and 24 distinct types of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Statistical analysis of these results suggests a much greater 'hidden diversity'. In contrast, there was no unusual richness in other organisms, such as higher fungi, mites, collembola and annelids. 4. Stable-isotope (C-13) technology was used to measure carbon fluxes and map the path of carbon through the food web. A novel finding was the rapidity with which carbon moves through the soil biota, revealing an extraordinarily dynamic soil ecosystem. 5. The combination of taxonomic diversity and rapid carbon flux makes the soil ecosystem highly resistant to perturbation through either changing soil structure or removing selected groups of organisms.},

abstract = {The pelagic (i.e. fishes that spend most of their time swimming and feeding in the water column) fish assemblage was examined within a temperate estuary to determine the seasonal patterns of abundance, biomass, richness, and species composition. These measures were related to abiotic measures including temperature, salinity, water transparency, and depth. Pelagic fish (n < 350 000) were sampled weekly from August 1995 through December 1996 in Great Bay in New Jersey, USA, with a pop net (5 m diameter, 5 m length, 3 mm cod end). The most frequently occurring and abundant species included Clupea harengus (frequency of occurrence = 27.4%; abundance = 80.5% of total catch), Menidia menidia (83.5, 10.6%), Anchoa mitchilli (66.5, 6.0%), and Anchoa hepsetus (23.1, 1.9%). There were strong seasonal trends in species richness, total abundance, and total biomass with peaks in spring, summer, and autumn, and very low values for these parameters in winter. In addition, there were five seasonal groupings within this pelagic fish assemblage that were primarily, but not exclusively, represented by young-of-the-year (age 0+). Winter (December-March) was represented by adult Gasterosteus aculeatus and age 1 + by M. menidia. Spring (April-early June) was overwhelmingly dominated by age 0+ C. harengus. Early summer (late June-early July) was relatively species rich and characterized by age 0+ of Brevoortia tyrannus, Pomatomus saltatrix, Alosa pseudoharengus, and age 1+ of Anchoa mitchilli. Late summer (late July-August) remained relatively species rich and included mostly age 0+ of A. mitchilli, A. hepsetus, and M. menidia. Autumn (September-November) continued to have high catches of age 0+ of M. menidia and A. mitchilli. As expected for temperate estuaries, the best of the measured abiotic predictors of these groupings included temperature, salinity, and degree of change in temperature. However, timing of life history characteristics, such as location, and timing of reproduction and migration also influenced the seasonal occurrence of these pelagic species. The large abundance and biomass of a relatively few species, as observed in this study, are typical of estuaries, although this is one of the few studies that have focused solely on the pelagic component of estuarine fish assemblages. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) statistical results provide vegetation decreasing/increasing trend as prior information for temporal unmixing analysis. Temporal unmixing analysis (TUA) results could reveal the dominant spatial distribution of decreasing vegetation. The results showed that decreasing vegetation areas in Jiangsu are distributed in the suburbs and newly constructed areas. For validation, the vegetation's decreasing cover is revealed by linear spectral mixture from Landsat data in three selected cities. Vegetation decreasing areas pixels are also calculated from land use maps in 2000 and 2010. The accuracy of integrated empirical orthogonal function and temporal unmixing analysis method is about 83.14%.

abstract = {Scientists disagree about the nature of biodiversity change. While there is evidence for widespread declines from population surveys, assemblage surveys reveal a mix of declines and increases. These conflicting conclusions may be caused by the use of different metrics: assemblage metrics may average out drastic changes in individual populations. Alternatively, differences may arise from data sources: populations monitored individually, versus whole-assemblage monitoring. To test these hypotheses, we estimated population change metrics using assemblage data. For a set of 23 241 populations, 16 009 species, in 158 assemblages, we detected significantly accelerating extinction and colonisation rates, with both rates being approximately balanced. Most populations (85%) did not show significant trends in abundance, and those that did were balanced between winners (8%) and losers (7%). Thus, population metrics estimated with assemblage data are commensurate with assemblage metrics and reveal sustained and increasing species turnover.},

abstract = {Interactions between humans and nature have profound consequences, which rarely are mutually beneficial. Further, behavioral and environmental changes can turn human–wildlife cooperative interactions into conflicts, threatening their continued existence. By tracking fine-scale behavioral interactions between artisanal fishers and wild dolphins targeting migratory mullets, we reveal that foraging synchrony is key to benefiting both predators. Dolphins herd mullet schools toward the coast, increasing prey availability within the reach of the net-casting fishers, who gain higher foraging success—but only when matching the casting behavior with the dolphins' foraging cues. In turn, when dolphins approach the fishers' nets closely and cue fishers in, they dive for longer and modify their active foraging echolocation to match the time it takes for nets to sink and close over mullets—but only when fishers respond to their foraging cues appropriately. Using long-term demographic surveys, we show that cooperative foraging generates socioeconomic benefits for net-casting fishers and ca. 13% survival benefits for cooperative dolphins by minimizing spatial overlap with bycatch-prone fisheries. However, recent declines in mullet availability are threatening these short- and long-term benefits by reducing the foraging success of net-casting fishers and increasing the exposure of dolphins to bycatch in the alternative fisheries. Using a numerical model parametrized with our empirical data, we predict that environmental and behavioral changes are pushing this traditional human–dolphin cooperation toward extinction. We propose two possible conservation actions targeting fishers' behavior that could prevent the erosion of this century-old fishery, thereby safeguarding one of the last remaining cases of human–wildlife cooperation.},

abstract = {Ecological interactions are not uniform across time and can vary with environmental conditions. Yet, interactions among species are often measured with short-term controlled experiments whose outcomes can depend greatly on the particular environmental conditions under which they are performed. As an alternative, we use empirical dynamic modeling to estimate species interactions across a wide range of environmental conditions directly from existing long-term monitoring data. In our case study from a southern California kelp forest, we test whether interactions between multiple kelp and sea urchin species can be reliably reconstructed from time-series data and whether those interactions vary predictably in strength and direction across observed fluctuations in temperature, disturbance, and low-frequency oceanographic regimes. We show that environmental context greatly alters the strength and direction of species interactions. In particular, the state of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation seems to drive the competitive balance between kelp species, asserting bottom-up control on kelp ecosystem dynamics. We show the importance of specifically studying variation in interaction strength, rather than mean interaction outcomes, when trying to understand the dynamics of complex ecosystems. The significant context dependency in species interactions found in this study argues for a greater utilization of long-term data and empirical dynamic modeling in studies of the dynamics of other ecosystems. species interactions | kelp-forest ecology | empirical dynamic modeling | nonlinear dynamics Interactions between species drive patterns of diversity, stability, resilience, and productivity in nature (1-4). In any ecosystem, the collection of species interactions determines community dynamics. Yet, since environmental conditions can influence these species interactions and environmental conditions can vary greatly over space or time (5-9), shifting interspecies dynamics can drive complex ecosystem changes. For example, the Stress Gradient Hypothesis (10-12) posits that interactions among species within a trophic level can shift from competitive to facilitative across large gradients of stress (e.g., thermal, nutrient, or water stress), with important implications for community dynamics. Similar hypotheses have been posited about shifts in other key species-interaction types, like parasitism and mutualism (13, 14), and consumer-prey interactions (15). Although ecologists have long recognized that many important species interactions may vary greatly over time and space, this context dependency remains very difficult to effectively measure and describe. Field experiments that measure interactions can generally be performed at only a few places over a relatively short window of time. They are therefore inevitably subject to only a subset of potential environmental contexts that may not encompass the full range of conditions experienced by that ecosystem over longer time scales or broader geographies (16). The resulting constraints increase the chance that the profound influence of environmental context on the outcome of species interactions ranging from keystone predation (8) to competition (6, 17, 18) to protective symbioses (19-21) will remain underappreciated. Since expanding the temporal and spatial scales of such experiments to rectify these challenges is a daunting task, we need additional tools. Moreover, even when context dependency of species interactions has been examined explicitly, studies commonly focus on estimating mean interaction strengths, rather than more comprehensive examinations of interaction variance and dynamics (9). This averaging approach may be appropriate for answering certain questions, but if species interactions are highly variable in both magnitude and direction-and therefore "weak" when averaged-key species interactions that are important drivers of community change may be dismissed as insignificant observational noise (4). Meeting these significant challenges requires placing interspecific interactions into their appropriate full environmental contexts. Controlled experiments can sort out the relative and interactive effects of a few orthogonal environmental drivers at a time; for example, examination of the effects of ocean warming and acidification on algal competition (22). But as species-interaction webs and lists of important environmental variables grow in size, fully factorial experimental designs quickly become unwieldy, if not impossible, to implement. One potential solution may lie in coupling long-term ecological observations Significance Interactions between species in nature can vary in strength and direction and may be driven by environmental variation. We use kelp forests as an example to show how varying species-interaction strengths, estimated directly from time-series data on species abundances, can be related to low-frequency variation in environmental drivers. Our approach has relevance to the study of species interactions in other ecological systems where environmental and monitoring data exist, but experimental studies of species interactions are infeasible.},

The sequence of mortality events in most areas is consistent with the hypothesis that the causative agent was dispersed by major surface currents over large distances. However, some of the late die-offs in the southeastern Caribbean do not fit this pattern. Several lines of indirect evidence suggest that the phenomenon is due to a water-borne pathogen.

abstract = {The hypothesis that biotic interactions strengthen toward lower latitudes provides a framework for linking community-scale processes with the macroecological scales that define our biosphere. Despite the importance of this hypothesis for understanding community assembly and ecosystem functioning, the extent to which interaction strength varies across latitude and the effects of this variation on natural communities remain unresolved. Predation in particular is central to ecological and evolutionary dynamics across the globe, yet very few studies explore both community-scale causes and outcomes of predation across latitude. Here we expand beyond prior studies to examine two important components of predation strength: intensity of predation (including multiple dimensions of the predator guild) and impact on prey community biomass and structure, providing one of the most comprehensive examinations of predator–prey interactions across latitude. Using standardized experiments, we tested the hypothesis that predation intensity and impact on prey communities were stronger at lower latitudes. We further assessed prey recruitment to evaluate the potential for this process to mediate predation effects. We used sessile marine invertebrate communities and their fish predators in nearshore environments as a model system, with experiments conducted at 12 sites in four regions spanning the tropics to the subarctic. Our results show clear support for an increase in both predation intensity and impact at lower relative to higher latitudes. The predator guild was more diverse at low latitudes, with higher predation rates, longer interaction durations, and larger predator body sizes, suggesting stronger predation intensity in the tropics. Predation also reduced prey biomass and altered prey composition at low latitudes, with no effects at high latitudes. Although recruitment rates were up to three orders of magnitude higher in the tropics than the subarctic, prey replacement through this process was insufficient to dampen completely the strong impacts of predators in the tropics. Our study provides a novel perspective on the biotic interaction hypothesis, suggesting that multiple components of the predator community likely contribute to predation intensity at low latitudes, with important consequences for the structure of prey communities.},

These synergistic pressures have resulted in a historic oyster fishery collapse and the expansion of mangroves, which are displacing native salt marsh. Understanding how these natural and man-made-driven changes have affected the nekton community is essential for the sustainable management of this coastal region. To evaluate changes in nekton occurrence and distribution in Apalachicola Bay, we analyzed 20 years of biological monitoring data. Our results indicated that spatial variation in species' populations was driven by differences in salinity, while seasonal changes were driven by temperature. Freshwater inflow is the primary driver of salinity, and these differences demonstrated that river flow reductions have the potential to alter nekton communities. The effects of climate-driven droughts and anthropogenic freshwater flow reductions on estuarine community structure highlight the importance of maintaining sufficient river flow for nursery areas, which provide ecosystem services for the region. Ultimately, these findings support the continued need for monitoring programs that track accelerating ecosystem change and provide a clearer understanding for how community composition will respond to global change.},

abstract = {. The tops of intertidal boulders on the east coast of Australia may carry a half-dozen algae, while the under- sides may support a dozen or more species of sessile ani- mals; mobile forms such as molluscs, crustaceans, and echinoderms are also common. These organisms are dis- turbed when boulders are moved by waves or buried in sand. Experiments were done to test the hypothesis that these disturbances are responsible for the reduced diversity and abundance of the assemblages on the undersides of small boulders. Boulders on one shore were bolted to the substratum to prevent movement by waves. In two separate experiments on another shore, boulders with and without attached organisms were buried in a few centimetres of sand. All experiments included relevant controls and were done high and low on the shore using rocks of several sizes. The assemblages of algae developing on the tops of all stabilised boulders, regardless of size, were similar to those on boulders free to roll indicating that, in contrast to results elsewhere, disturbance by waves was too infrequent or slight to affect these species. The tops of rocks were also rarely buried in sand and the main influences on the community in this situation were apparently exposure at low-tide and grazing gastropods. More species, however, did settle or survive on the un- dersides of rocks which were free of sand or could not be moved by waves; thus disturbances were important in this situation. In the absence of disturbance low on the shore, much or all space was occupied and sessile species such as sponges and ascidians overgrew other forms and reduced diversity. This did not happen higher on the shore and here diversity was simply an increasing function of rock-size. Overall disturbance played a similar role in all places- it killed organisms and created free space- but the final effects on the community varied depending upon the species present and the actions of other factors.},

abstract = {The present study analyzed the effects of seasonal variation on the stability of fish-based metrics and their capability to detect changes in fish assemblages, which is yet poorly understood despite the general idea that guilds are more resilient to natural variability than species abundances. Three zones subject to different levels of fishing pressure inside the Arr{\'{a}}bida Marine Protected Area (MPA) were sampled seasonally. The results showed differences between warm (summer and autumn) and cold (winter and spring) seasons, with the autumn clearly standing out. In general, the values of the metrics density of juveniles, density of invertebrate feeders and density of omnivores increased in warm seasons, which can be attributed to differences in recruitment patterns, spawning migrations and feeding activity among seasons. The density of generalist/opportunistic individuals was sensitive to the effect of fishing, with higher values at zones with the lowest level of protection, while the density of individuals with high commercial value only responded to fishing in the autumn, due to a cumulative result of both juveniles and adults abundances during this season. Overall, this study showed that seasonal variability affects structural and functional features of the fish assemblage and that might influence the detection of changes as a result of anthropogenic pressures. The choice of a specific season, during warm sea conditions after the spawning period (July-October), seems to be more adequate to assess changes on rocky-reef fish assemblages. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Myriophyllum spicatum L. and Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle grown on 40 different sediments from 17 geographically widespread North American lakes indicated 10- and 20-fold declines in growth with increasing sediment organic matter up to a concentration of $\sim$20% dry sediment mass. Poor growth was obtained also on inorganic sediments with a sand fraction exceeding 75% dry sediment mass. Diminished growth on organic sediments occurred at low values of sediment density, and on sands, at high values of sediment density. Differential centrifugation of organic sediment, facilitating an increase in sediment density with no change in organic matter content, stimulated Hydrilla growth, indicating that sediment density rather than organic matter content was most influential in regulating growth. Macrophyte growth and nutrient mass accumulation in shoots were closely correlated, but essen? tially unrelated to concentrations of nutrients in shoots. The magnitude {r value) and statistical sig? nificance of correlations between nutrients in macrophyte shoots and sediments varied appreciably, depending on the form of shoot nutrient data (concentration or accumulation), and the type (interstitial water or total), and basis (mass or volume) of sediment nutrient data. Growth and nutrient accu? mulation were highly correlated with sediment nutrient concentrations based on volume, indicating interrelationships among growth, nutrition, and sediment density. Additions of P and Fe in combination to organic sediments with N supplied in the overlying solution resulted in significant growth increases in Hydrilla, suggesting that diminished growth on unfavorable sediments was caused by multiple nutrient limitation. Nutrient uptake on low-density organic sediments was apparently limited by long diffusion distances. Limited rates of nutrient diffusion and exchange in coarse-textured sediments, in addition to low nutrient status, may have contributed to their poor ability to support macrophyte growth. Thus, mechanisms of growth limitation on both sands and organic sediments appear to involve nutrition.}},

Changes in phenology may be important to ecosystem function because the level of response to climate change may vary across functional groups and multiple trophic levels. The decoupling of phenological relationships will have important ramifications for trophic interactions, altering food-web structures and leading to eventual ecosystem-level changes. Temperate marine environments may be particularly vulnerable to these changes because the recruitment success of higher trophic levels is highly dependent on synchronization with pulsed planktonic production. Using long-term data of 66 plankton taxa during the period from 1958 to 2002, we investigated whether climate warming signals are emergent across all trophic levels and functional groups within an ecological community. Here we show that not only is the marine pelagic community responding to climate changes, but also that the level of response differs throughout the community and the seasonal cycle, leading to a mismatch between trophic levels and functional groups.},

We found significant changes in taxonomic and trophic composition of freshwater fishes in the Ohio River Basin. Annual species richness varied from 31 to 90 species and generally increased with year. Temporal trajectories were present for taxonomic and trophic assemblages. Assemblage structure based on taxonomy was correlated with land use change (decrease in agriculture and increase in forest). Taxonomic assemblage structure was also correlated with altered hydrology variables of increased minimum discharge, decreased fall rate, and increased rise rate. Trophic composition of fish catch correlated with land use change (decrease in agriculture and increase in forest) and altered hydrology. Altered hydrology of increased minimum discharge, increased fall discharge, decreased base flows, and increased number of high pulse events was correlated with increased counts of herbivore-detritivores and decreased counts of piscivores and planktivores. We did not find directional changes in life history composition. We hypothesized a shift occurred from benthic to phytoplankton production throughout the basin that may have decreased secondary production of benthic invertebrates. This may also be responsible for lower trophic position of invertivore and piscivore fishes observed in other studies.},

abstract = {Abstract Understanding the mechanisms of ecological community dynamics and how they could be affected by environmental changes is important. Population dynamic models have well known ecological parameters that describe key characteristics of species, such as the effect of environmental noise and demographic variance on the dynamics, the long-term growth rate and strength of density regulation. These parameters are also central for detecting and understanding changes in communities of species; however, incorporating such vital parameters into models of community dynamics is challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate how generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) specified as intercept-only models with different random effects can be used to fit dynamic species abundance distributions. Each random effect has an ecologically meaningful interpretation either describing general and species-specific responses to environmental stochasticity in time or space, or variation in growth rate and carrying capacity among species. We use simulations to show that the accuracy of the estimation depends on the strength of density regulation in discrete population dynamics. The estimation of different covariance- and population dynamic parameters, with corresponding statistical uncertainties, is demonstrated for case studies of fish and bat communities. We find that species heterogeneity is the main factor of spatial and temporal community similarity for both case studies.},

Here, we review empirical approaches to metacommunities, both observational and experimental, pertaining to how well they relate to and test theoretical metacommunity paradigms and how well they capture the realities of natural ecosystems. First, we show that the species-sorting and mass-effects paradigms are the most commonly tested and supported paradigms. Second, the dynamics observed can often be ascribed to two or more of the four non-exclusive paradigms. Third, empirical approaches relate only weakly to the concise assumptions and predictions made by the paradigms. Consequently, we suggest major avenues of improvement for empirical metacommunity approaches, including the integration across theoretical approaches and the incorporation of evolutionary and meta-ecosystem dynamics. We hope for metacommunity ecology to thereby bridge existing gaps between empirical and theoretical work, thus becoming a more powerful framework to understand dynamics across ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Animal and plant populations often occupy a variety of local areas and may experience different local birth and death rates in different areas. When this occurs, reproductive surpluses from productive source habitats may maintain populations in sink habitats, where local reproductive success fails to keep pace with local mortality. For animals with active habitat selection, an equilibrium with both source and sink habitats occupied can be both ecologically and evolutionarily stable. If the surplus population of the source is large and the per capita deficit in the sink is small, only a small fraction of the total population will occur in areas where local reproduction is sufficient to compensate for local mortality. In this sense, the realized niche may be larger than the fundamental niche. Consequently, the particular species assemblage occupying any local study site may consist of a mixture of source and sink populations and may be as much or more influenced by the type and proximity of other habitats as by the resources and other conditions at the site.},

abstract = {An organism's colouration is often linked to the environment in which it lives. The fishes that inhabit coral reefs are extremely diverse in colouration, but the specific environmental factors that support this extreme diversity remain unclear. Interestingly, much of the aesthetic and intrinsic value humans place on coral reefs (a core ecosystem service they provide) is based on this extreme diversity of colours. However, like many processes on coral reefs, the relationship between colouration and the environment is likely to be impacted by global environmental change. Using a novel community-level measure of fish colouration, as perceived by humans, we explore the potential links between fish community colouration and the environment. We then asked if this relationship is impacted by human-induced environmental disturbances, e.g. mass coral bleaching events, using a community-level dataset spanning 27 years on the Great Barrier Reef. We found that the diversity of colours found within a fish community is directly related to the composition of the local environment. Areas with a higher cover of structurally complex corals contained fish species with more diverse and brighter colourations. Most notably, fish community colouration contracted significantly in the years following the 1998 global coral bleaching event. Fishes with colouration directly appealing to human aesthetics are becoming increasingly rare, with the potential for marked declines in the perceived colour of reef fish communities in the near future.

abstract = {Whether interspecific hybridization is important as a mechanism that generates biological diversity is a matter of controversy. Whereas some authors focus on the potential of hybridization as a source of genetic variation, functional novelty and new species, others argue against any important role, because reduced fitness would typically render hybrids an evolutionary dead end. By drawing on recent developments in the genetics and ecology of hybridization and on principles of ecological speciation theory, I develop a concept that reconciles these views and adds a new twist to this debate. Because hybridization is common when populations invade new environments and potentially elevates rates of response to selection, it predisposes colonizing populations to rapid adaptive diversification under disruptive or divergent selection. I discuss predictions and suggest tests of this hybrid swarm theory of adaptive radiation and review published molecular phylogenies of adaptive radiations in light of the theory.},

abstract = {Mangroves are species of halophytic intertidal trees and shrubs derived from tropical genera and are likely delimited in latitudinal range by varying sensitivity to cold. There is now sufficient evidence that mangrove species have proliferated at or near their poleward limits on at least five continents over the past half century, at the expense of salt marsh. Avicennia is the most cold-tolerant genus worldwide, and is the subject of most of the observed changes. Avicennia germinans has extended in range along the USA Atlantic coast and expanded into salt marsh as a consequence of lower frost frequency and intensity in the southern USA. The genus has also expanded into salt marsh at its southern limit in Peru, and on the Pacific coast of Mexico. Mangroves of several species have expanded in extent and replaced salt marsh where protected within mangrove reserves in Guangdong Province, China. In south-eastern Australia, the expansion of Avicennia marina into salt marshes is now well documented, and Rhizophora stylosa has extended its range southward, while showing strong population growth within estuaries along its southern limits in northern New South Wales. Avicennia marina has extended its range southwards in South Africa. The changes are consistent with the poleward extension of temperature thresholds coincident with sea-level rise, although the specific mechanism of range extension might be complicated by limitations on dispersal or other factors. The shift from salt marsh to mangrove dominance on subtropical and temperate shorelines has important implications for ecological structure, function, and global change adaptation. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Global concern about human impact on biological diversity has triggered an intense research agenda on drivers and consequences of biodiversity change in parallel with international policy seeking to conserve biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions. Quantifying the trends in biodiversity is far from trivial, however, as recently documented by meta-analyses, which report little if any net change in local species richness through time. Here, we summarise several limitations of species richness as a metric of biodiversity change and show that the expectation of directional species richness trends under changing conditions is invalid. Instead, we illustrate how a set of species turnover indices provide more information content regarding temporal trends in biodiversity, as they reflect how dominance and identity shift in communities over time. We apply these metrics to three monitoring datasets representing different ecosystem types. In all datasets, nearly complete species turnover occurred, but this was disconnected from any species richness trends. Instead, turnover was strongly influenced by changes in species presence (identities) and dominance (abundances). We further show that these metrics can detect phases of strong compositional shifts in monitoring data and thus identify a different aspect of biodiversity change decoupled from species richness. Synthesis and applications: Temporal trends in species richness are insufficient to capture key changes in biodiversity in changing environments. In fact, reductions in environmental quality can lead to transient increases in species richness if immigration or extinction has different temporal dynamics. Thus, biodiversity monitoring programmes need to go beyond analyses of trends in richness in favour of more meaningful assessments of biodiversity change.},

Metapopulations are classified based on spatial complexity and the degree of connectedness between populations. Designation of effective restocking sites requires careful attention to metapopulation dynamics; pop- ulations in the metapopulation can differ dramatically in demography and connectivity, and the sites they occupy can vary in habitat quality. Source populations, which are optimal for restocking, can be distinct geographically and may be a small percentage of the metapopulation. Sink areas, where restocking is almost certain to be fruitless, can nonetheless serve as pro- ductive locations for habitat restoration since larvae from source reefs are likely to recruit to these areas. Effective restocking of metapopulations is most likely to be attained by selection of optimal source populations; inattention to metapopulation dynamics can doom restoration efforts with marine species.},

abstract = {Aim: The dominant forest tree in Europe, European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), covers large areas of continental Europe and thus experiences diverse climatic conditions. In the face of predicted climate change and shifts of distribution ranges, it is important to understand the diverse climate–growth relationships towards distribution margins. Beech is generally reported to be sensitive to summer drought towards dry and continental regions; yet, few studies have investigated climate sensitivity towards the cold distribution margin of beech. We hypothesized that at colder sites (a) growth of beech is more sensitive to winter cold, (b) growth is less influenced by summer drought, and (c) stand-wide growth reductions (negative pointer years) are related to extreme winter cold events. Taxon: European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). Location: A large gradient of decreasing winter temperature ($\Delta$T >4 K along 500 km) from Rostock (Germany) to Gda{\'{n}}sk (Poland). Methods: We analysed climate–growth relationships and the nature of growth reductions of 11 beech stands from more central to cold marginal beech populations. Results: Towards the cold marginal populations, growth became increasingly sensitive to winter cold (February temperature) and less sensitive to summer water availability (June precipitation). Likewise, negative pointer years coincided with winter cold anomalies at the colder sites and with summer drought anomalies at the warmer sites. Thus, over the studied gradient, the general sensitivity of beech to summer drought transitions into sensitivity to winter cold. Main conclusions: A range shift of beech across the current cold distribution margin is often assumed to compensate for habitat and productivity losses of drought-prone southern and central populations. With respect to the winter cold sensitivity found in our study, such assumptions should be taken with caution. Since winter cold events are predicted to persist with similar frequency and magnitude even during predicted climate warming, beech populations in the newly colonized habitat might be significantly sensitive to winter cold.},

Although nutrition is one important factor determining resource type, the growth response of a population to resources also depends on the interaction between a species' foraging methods and the spatial distribution of the resources. For example, two resources which are nutritionally perfectly substitutable may be operationally switching, antagonistic, or complementary because of spatial heterogeneity. A graphical, equilibrium theory of resource competition allows prediction of the outcome of interactions between several consumers for the various classes of resources. The technique requires information on (1) resource type (growth isoclines), (2) resource preference, (3) resource supply processes, and (4) mortality rates for all species. For all resource types, the major criterion for stable coexistence is that each species consume relatively more of the one resource which more limits its own growth rate.},

abstract = {Floral scent is a key component of floral display, and probably one of the first floral attractants linking insect pollinators to the radiation of Angiosperms. In this article, we investigate floral scent in two extra-tropical genera of Annonaceae. We discuss floral scent in the context of differing pollination strategies in these genera, and compare their scent to that of a close tropical relative. Floral volatiles were collected for Annona glabra, Asimina and Deeringothamnus whole flowers and dissected floral organs, using a standardized static-headspace solid phase microextraction method. Scents were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and identified using known standards. The floral scents of these species are highly dynamic, varying between floral organs, sexual stages and species. Maroon-flowered species of Asimina produce 'yeasty' odors, dominated by fermentation volatiles and occasionally containing sulfurous or nitrogenous compounds. White-flowered species of Asimina and Deeringothamnus produce pleasant odors characterized by lilac compounds, benzenoids and hydrocarbons. Annona glabra produces a strong, fruity-acetonic scent dominated by 3-pentanyl acetate and 1,8-cineole. The fermented/decaying scents of maroon-flowered species of Asimina suggest mimicry-based pollination strategies similar to aroids and stapeliads, whereas the pleasant scents of white-flowered species of Asimina suggest honest, reward-based pollination strategies. The scent of Annona glabra is typical of specialized beetle pollination systems common to tropical Annonaceae. {\textcopyright} 2009 New Phytologist Trust.},

This issue is of particular concern for reef-fish communities, where predation is a key process driving ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Here, we synthesize existing experiments that have isolated the effects of mesopredators to quantify the role of predation in driving changes in the abundance and biodiversity of recently settled reef fishes. On average, predators reduced prey abundance through generalist foraging behavior, which, through a statistical sampling artifact, caused a reduction in alpha diversity and an increase in beta diversity. Thus, the synthesized experiments provide evidence that predation reduces overall abundance within prey communities, but—after accounting for sampling effects—does not cause disproportionate effects on biodiversity.},

abstract = {Issue: Biodiversity change, that is how the taxonomic identities and abundances of species in ecological systems are changing over time, has two facets: temporal $\alpha$ diversity and temporal $\beta$ diversity. To date, temporal $\alpha$ diversity has received most attention even though compositional shifts in assemblages exceed expectations based on ecological theory. Growing concern about the state of the world's biodiversity highlights the need for better understanding of the extent, and consequences, of compositional reorganization in ecological systems. Challenges: Most methods of measuring $\beta$ diversity have been developed in a spatial context. We discuss the additional challenges involved in the assessment of temporal change, summarize existing methodological approaches, highlight the importance of establishing relevant baselines, and identify the need for appropriate null models of temporal $\beta$ diversity. Given considerable potential for research on the macroecology of temporal $\beta$ diversity we suggest future directions and challenges. Conclusions: Although data availability remains the main impediment to improved quantification of temporal $\beta$ diversity at macroecological scales, there are substantial opportunities for improved methodology and theory. Taxonomic $\beta$ diversity has received most attention, but other dimensions of diversity, including functional and phylogenetic, should be part of integrated assessments of biodiversity change. Future approaches need to be ecologically meaningful and interpretable as well as statistically robust.},

In the presence of fish, filamentous green algae are reduced to low, prostrate webs, infested with chironomids. When the absence of large fish releases smaller predators that suppress chironomids, algal biomass is higher, and tall upright algal turfs become covered with diatoms and cyanobacteria. These manipulations provide evidence that the Hairston, Smith, Slobodkin-Fretwell theory of trophic control, which predicts that plants will be alternately limited by resources or herbivores in food webs with odd and even numbers of trophic levels, has application to river communitics.},

abstract = {There is increasing concern that accelerating environmental change attributed to human-induced warming of the planet may substantially alter the patterns, distribution and intensity of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). Changes in temperature, ocean acidification, precipitation, nutrient stress or availability, and the physical structure of the water column all influence the productivity, composition, and global range of phytoplankton assemblages, but large uncertainty remains about how integration of these climate drivers might shape future HABs. Presented here are the collective deliberations from a symposium on HABs and climate change where the research challenges to understanding potential linkages between HABs and climate were considered, along with new research directions to better define these linkages. In addition to the likely effects of physical (temperature, salinity, stratification, light, changing storm intensity), chemical (nutrients, ocean acidification), and biological (grazer) drivers on microalgae (senso lato), symposium participants explored more broadly the subjects of cyanobacterial HABs, benthic HABs, HAB effects on fisheries, HAB modelling challenges, and the contributions that molecular approaches can bring to HAB studies. There was consensus that alongside traditional research, HAB scientists must set new courses of research and practices to deliver the conceptual and quantitative advances required to forecast future HAB trends. These different practices encompass laboratory and field studies, long-term observational programs, retrospectives, as well as the study of socioeconomic drivers and linkages with aquaculture and fisheries. In anticipation of growing HAB problems, research on potential mitigation strategies should be a priority. It is recommended that a substantial portion of HAB research among laboratories be directed collectively at a small sub-set of HAB species and questions in order to fast-track advances in our understanding. Climate-driven changes in coastal oceanographic and ecological systems are becoming substantial, in some cases exacerbated by localized human activities. That, combined with the slow pace of decreasing global carbon emissions, signals the urgency for HAB scientists to accelerate efforts across disciplines to provide society with the necessary insights regarding future HAB trends.},

abstract = {Changes in growth rates, shifts in the spawning season, and shifts in the spawning area (latitude) are expected after an increase in sea temperature resulting from global warming. Fish can avoid higher temperatures by a poleward shift in the spawning area and a temporal shift in spawning timing. However, these shifts will include changes in daylength experienced during their early life stages. To understand comprehensively the possible effects of global warming on fish recruitment, effects of temperature and daylength on growth, daily ration, and growth efficiency of black rockfish, Sebastes cheni, a dominant species in coastal waters of the western North Pacific, were examined under wild and laboratory conditions. The growth rate was elevated at higher temperatures between 11.1 and 21.3°C. Growth efficiency was highest at 16°C. The effect of photoperiod on growth was also significant, with enhanced growth resulting from the longer daylength. The effect of shifts in spawning season and spawning area would differ among fish species and spawning season. Comparison of early growth under different daylength conditions between S. cheni and ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis, indicated that the shifts in spawning season and spawning area would have different effects on fish early life stages (FELSs) related to changes in daylength. Changes in daylength resulting from a poleward shift in the spawning area will have opposite effects for summer- and winter-growing FELSs, and the effects are more prominent at higher latitudes. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

abstract = {The variability of cold front passages in the southern United States and the effects of three teleconnection patterns on cold front frequencies are analyzed in this study. The Southern Oscillation is weakly correlated with cold front frequencies. However, cold front passage frequencies during El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a events are not significantly different. The Pacific/North American (PNA) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) teleconnection patterns exert a significant influence on cold front variability in this region. The PNA pattern is most strongly tied to variations in cold front passage frequencies in Florida. Meridional (zonal) flow conditions are associated with a southward (northward) displacement of storm tracks over the eastern United States, resulting in an increase (decrease) in cold front passages in Florida. Various parts of the southern United States are affected by the NAO. High NAO months are characterized by an expanded Atlantic Subtropical High which often results in fewer cold front passages in the eastern portions of the southern United States. During low NAO months, much of Texas experiences a higher frequency of cold front passages, a likely result of increased upper-air trough development over the region. {\textcopyright} 2003 by V. H.

abstract = {Amazon forests, which store ∼50% of tropical forest carbon and play a vital role in global water, energy, and carbon cycling, are predicted to experience both longer and more intense dry seasons by the end of the 21st century. However, the climate sensitivity of this ecosystem remains uncertain: several studies have predicted large-scale dieback of the Amazon, whereas several more recent studies predict that the biome will remain largely intact. Combining remote-sensing and ground-based observations with a size- and age-structured terrestrial ecosystem model, we explore the sensitivity and ecological resilience of these forests to changes in climate. We demonstrate that water stress operating at the scale of individual plants, combined with spatial variation in soil texture, explains observed patterns of variation in ecosystem biomass, composition, and dynamics across the region, and strongly influences the ecosystem's resilience to changes in dry season length. Specifically, our analysis suggests that in contrast to existing predictions of either stability or catastrophic biomass loss, the Amazon forest's response to a drying regional climate is likely to be an immediate, graded, heterogeneous transition from high-biomass moist forests to transitional dry forests and woody savannah-like states. Fire, logging, and other anthropogenic disturbances may, however, exacerbate these climate change-induced ecosystem transitions.},

abstract = {Little is known about long-term changes in estuarine fish populations and related environmental variations. Fishes in the temporarily open/closed East Kleinemonde Estuary were sampled bi-annually, in summer and winter, using seine and gill nets between December 1994 and July 2005. A total of 18 families, represented by 33 species, were recorded. The 10 most abundant species caught were consistently recorded in catches each year, but CPUE of individual species varied on an annual basis and this can often be related to mouth state. Multivariate analyses of the annual marine fish community identified two distinct groups, with more species recorded during years that succeeded spring (September to November) mouth-opening events than in years following no mouth-opening events in spring. Interannual community stability (IMD) and seriation (IMS) also increased from the years following no opening events in spring to the years that succeeded spring opening events. These results highlight the importance of the timing of mouth opening to the marine fish community in a temporarily open/closed estuary. This study reinforces the importance of long-term studies to understanding community changes in estuaries caused by environmental variations over different time scales. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The lionfish, Pterois volitans (Linnaeus) and Pterois miles (Bennett), invasion of the Western Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico has the potential to alter aquatic communities and represents a legitimate ecological concern. Several local removal programs have been initiated to control this invasion, but it is not known whether removal efforts can substantially reduce lionfish numbers to ameliorate these concerns. We used an age-structured population model to evaluate the potential efficacy of lionfish removal programs and identified critical data gaps for future studies. We used high and low estimates for uncertain parameters including: length at 50% vulnerability to harvest (L vul), instantaneous natural mortality (M), and the Goodyear compensation ratio (CR). The model predicted an annual exploitation rate between 35 and 65% would be required to cause recruitment overfishing on lionfish populations for our baseline parameter estimates for M and CR (0.5 and 15). Lionfish quickly recovered from high removal rates, reaching 90% of unfished biomass six years after a 50-year simulated removal program. Quantifying lionfish natural mortality and the size-selective vulnerability to harvest are the most important knowledge gaps for future research. We suggest complete eradication of lionfish through fishing is unlikely, and substantial reduction of adult abundance will require a long-term commitment and may be feasible only in small, localized areas where annual exploitation can be intense over multiple consecutive years.

abstract = {Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though sampies may be) or replicates are not statistically independent. In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experi- mental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27% of them, or 48% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudo- replication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict random- ization procedures. Comprehension ofthis conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre-layout (or conventional) and layout-specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how ecologists' under- standing of experimental design and statistics might be improved.},

abstract = {Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a ubiquitous phenomenon in marine and freshwater plankton communities. Most commonly, plankton migrate to surface waters at dusk and return to deeper waters at dawn. Up until recently, it was thought that DVM was triggered by a relative change in visible light intensity. However, evidence has shown that DVM also occurs in the deep sea where no direct and background sunlight penetrates. To identify whether such DVM is associated with latitudinal and seasonal day light variation, one and a half years of recorded acoustic data, a measure of zooplankton abundance and movement, were examined. Acoustic Doppler current profilers, moored at eight different sub-tropical latitudes in the North-Atlantic Ocean, measured in the vertical range of 500-1600 m. DVM was observed to follow day length variation with a change in season and latitude at all depths. DVM followed the rhythm of local sunrise and sunset precisely between 500 and 650 m. It continued below 650 m, where the deepest penetrable irradiance level are <10⁻⁷ times their near-surface values, but plankton shortened their time at depth by up to about 63% at 1600 m. This suggests light was no longer a cue for DVM. This trend stayed consistent both across latitudes and between the different seasons. It is hypothesized that another mechanism, rather than light, viz. a precise biochemical clock could maintain the solar diurnal and seasonal rhythms in deep sea plankton motions. In accordance with this hypothesis, the deepest plankton were consistently the first to migrate upwards.},

First, the findings document the existence of “harbinger zip codes.” If households in these zip codes adopt a new product, this is a signal that the new product will fail. Second, a series of comparisons reveal that households in harbinger zip codes make other decisions that differ from other households. The first comparison identifies harbinger zip codes using purchases from one retailer and then evaluates purchases at a different retailer. Households in harbinger zip codes purchase products from the second retailer that other households are less likely to purchase. The analysis next compares donations to congressional election candidates; households in harbinger zip codes donate to different candidates than households in neighboring zip codes, and they donate to candidates who are less likely to win. House prices in harbinger zip codes also increase at slower rates than in neighboring zip codes. Investigation of households that change zip codes indicates that the harbinger zip code effect is more due to where customers choose to live, rather than households influencing their neighbors' tendencies.},

abstract = {Climate extremes indices are evaluated for the northeast United States and adjacent Canada (Northeast) using gridded observations and twenty-three CMIP5 coupled models. Previous results have demonstrated observed increases in warm and wet extremes and decreases in cold extremes, consistent with changes expected in a warming world. Here, a significant shift is found in the distribution of observed total annual precipitation over 1981-2010. In addition, significant positive trends are seen in all observed wet precipitation indices over 1951-2010. For the Northeast region, CMIP5 models project significant shifts in the distributions of most temperature and precipitation indices by 2041-2070. By the late century, the coldest (driest) future extremes are projected to be warmer (wetter) than the warmest (wettest) extremes at present. The multimodel interquartile range compares well with observations, providing a measure of confidence in the projections in this region. Spatial analysis suggests that the largest increases in heavy precipitation extremes are projected for northern, coastal, and mountainous areas. Results suggest that the projected increase in total annual precipitation is strongly influenced by increases in winter wet extremes. The largest decreases in cold extremes are projected for northern and interior portions of the Northeast, while the largest increases in summer warm extremes are projected for densely populated southern, central, and coastal areas. This study provides a regional analysis and verification of the latest generation of CMIP global models specifically for the Northeast, useful to stakeholders focused on understanding and adapting to climate change and its impacts in the region.},

abstract = {The tropically associated black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) is experiencing a climate-induced range shift and expanding into salt marshes of northern Florida, southern Louisiana and most recently, Horn Island, MS. To date, little is known about how black mangroves function as nursery habitat for important fishery species such as shrimps or how their increase may affect survival of such species. The main objective of our study was to determine habitat preference and survival rates of common, economically important penaeid shrimps in the presence and absence of the increasingly abundant tropical predator, the gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus). We also examined the effects of habitat identity and structure on juvenile white shrimp (Litopenaeus setiferus) and brown shrimp (Farfantepenaeus aztecus) behavior, using preference experiments in indoor mesocosms both with and without the predatory gray snapper. Results showed that shrimp prefer Spartina over Avicennia with or without predation risk. Survival of shrimp was lowest in sand and highest in medium-density Spartina. Thus, a marsh-to-mangrove habitat conversion could ultimately result in decreased shrimp survival.},

abstract = {Regime shifts are substantial, long-lasting reorganizations of complex systems, such as ecosystems. Large ecosystem changes such as eutrophication, shifts among vegetation types, degradation of coral reefs and regional climate change often come as surprises because we lack leading indicators for regime shifts. Increases in variability of ecosystems have been suggested to foreshadow ecological regime shifts. However, it may be difficult to discern variability due to impending regime shift from that of exogenous drivers that affect the ecosystem. We addressed this problem using a model of lake eutrophication. Lakes are subject to fluctuations in recycling associated with regime shifts, as well as fluctuating nutrient inputs. Despite the complications of noisy inputs, increasing variability of lake-water phosphorus was discernible prior to the shift to eutrophic conditions. Simulations show that rising standard deviation (SD) could signal impending shifts about a decade in advance. The rising SD was detected by studying variability around predictions of a simple time-series model, and did not depend on detailed knowledge of the actual ecosystem dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

In the approach, UML and OCL models describe system structures formally with UML class diagrams and OCL class invariants. Test cases in form of object diagrams are constructed and employed for property inspection. With the approach one can prove model properties like model constraint independence for the structural model part. Thus important model properties can be analyzed on the modeling level without the need for implementing the model.

abstract = {The evolution of sexual dimorphism in quantitative characters under natural and sexual selection acting differently on the sexes is analyzed using population genetics models. The effects of genes when in males may be correlated with their effects when in females, producing correlated selective responses between the sexes, so that male and female phenotypes cannot evolve independently But under weak natural selection with constant relative fitnesses, in the absence of sexual selection, the joint evolution of the mean phenotypes of the sexes increases the mean fitness in a population, and if there is genetic variation for sexual dimorphism each sex eventually achieves a locally optimum phenotype. With sexual selection, fitnesses are generally frequency-dependent and evolution of the mean phenotypes does not maximize the mean fitness. Provided individual fitnesses exist, at equilibrium natural and sexual selection balance in each sex. A moderate intensity of sexual selection acting on a character under weak natural selection toward an intermediate optimum phenotype can produce a large deviation of the mean phenotype from the optimum and a substantial decrease of the mean fitness in a population, increasing the probability of extinction. When homologous characters in males and females vary similarly and are highly correlated genetically, the rate of evolution of sexual dimorphism may be one or more orders of magnitude slower than that for the average phenotype in a population. Methods for partitioning sexual dimorphism into contributions from natural and sexual selection are discussed, and genetic experiments are suggested for testing the involvement of non-equilibrium correlated selective responses between the sexes in observed cases of sexual dimorphism.},

abstract = {We examined interannual differences in fish assemblage structure in Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor, Florida, from 1996 to 2005 to reveal the extent of hurricane-induced changes in relation to multiannual variability for five different assemblages in each estuary: small-bodied fishes (,generally 80-mm standard length) along river shorelines, in river channels, along bay shorelines, and on the bay shelf (, 1.5-m water depth); and large-bodied fishes (. generally 100-mm standard length) along bay shorelines. Fish assemblages tended to differ between estuaries, as did interannual variability in assemblage structure. In the lower portions of tributary rivers to Tampa Bay, the small-bodied shoreline fish assemblage during August 2004 to July 2005, i.e., during and after the multiple hurricanes, was different from assemblages of August to July in previous years. This may have been a result of physical displacement of fish or suboptimal salinities caused by increased freshwater inflow. The small-bodied shoreline fish assemblage in Charlotte Harbor also differed between pre- hurricane and hurricane periods, possibly because damage to vegetated shorelines affected fish survival through a decrease in feeding and refuge habitats. In the remaining habitats, fish assemblage structure from August 2004 to July 2005 were within the range of variability exhibited over the 9-yr study period. There were several unusual fish assemblages that appeared to be attributable to drought conditions (1996, 1999–2000), suggesting that other major environmental perturbations may be as important as hurricanes in influencing assemblage structure. We conclude that although the 2004 hurricane season affected some of the fish assemblages of Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor, these assemblages generally appeared quite resilient to natural environmental perturbations from a decadal perspective.},

abstract = {1. Climate change impacts have been observed on individual species and species subsets; however, it remains to be seen whether there are systematic, coherent assemblage-wide responses to climate change that could be used as a representative indicator of changing biological state. 2. European shelf seas are warming faster than the adjacent land masses and faster than the global average. We explore the year-by-year distributional response of North Sea bottom-dwelling (demersal) fishes to temperature change over the 25 years from 1980 to 2004. The centres of latitudinal and depth distributions of 28 fishes were estimated from species-abundance–location data collected on an annual fish monitoring survey. 3. Individual species responses were aggregated into 19 assemblages reflecting physiology (thermal preference and range), ecology (body size and abundance-occupancy patterns), biogeography (northern, southern and presence of range boundaries), and susceptibility to human impact (fishery target, bycatch and non-target species). 4. North Sea winter bottom temperature has increased by 1{\textperiodcentered}6 ° C over 25 years, with a 1 ° C increase in 1988–1989 alone. During this period, the whole demersal fish assemblage deepened by $\sim$3{\textperiodcentered}6 m decade –1 and the deepening was coherent for most assemblages. 5. The latitudinal response to warming was heterogeneous, and reflects (i) a northward shift in the mean latitude of abundant, widespread thermal specialists, and (ii) the southward shift of relatively small, abundant southerly species with limited occupancy and a northern range boundary in the North Sea. 6. Synthesis and applications. The deepening of North Sea bottom-dwelling fishes in response to climate change is the marine analogue of the upward movement of terrestrial species to higher altitudes. The assemblage-level depth responses, and both latitudinal responses, covary with temperature and environmental variability in a manner diagnostic of a climate change impact. The deepening of the demersal fish assemblage in response to temperature could be used as a biotic indicator of the effects of climate change in the North Sea and other semi-enclosed seas.},

abstract = {Estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems can have significant intra- and interannual variability in faunal community structure, complicating management response to disturbances as disturbance effects must be detectable within normal variability and on timescales relevant to management entities. We examined a long-term, multi-gear dataset on estuarine faunal (fish and select invertebrate) communities to determine if community structure changes due to disturbances could be detected on management-relevant timescales (e.g., years), given that these communities have known seasonal and interannual variability. Results from multivariate, community-based analyses, and several univariate diversity indices for fauna of Tampa Bay, Florida, USA suggested general community stability over the long term, with the exceptions of 2005–2006 (prolonged red tide event) and 2010 (extreme cold event in winter). Community structure was notably outside the typical variability for both time periods. In 2005, species richness decreased by half for one gear type and was the lowest on record for the other two gear types. In 2010, when the relative abundance of a top predator decreased by 50% from cold-related mortality, Simpson's diversity index was the lowest on record for one gear type. The red tide and extreme-cold events differed in duration and the number of taxa directly impacted (multispecies vs. single-species, respectively) but both multivariate and univariate analyses indicated significant deviation in the faunal community structure during these years. Within 1–3 years after these major events, however, the community seemed to have returned to a structure like that of previous years, suggesting long-term stability and resilience. Our results confirm that multivariate and univariate analyses can detect major disturbances to estuarine faunal communities, which gives management entities options for which analysis approach is appropriate for their needs. Since the Tampa Bay faunal communities recovered within 3 years, we suggest that where long-term monitoring exists, active restoration might be deferred while monitoring for signs of recovery following the removal of a perturbation. This is a fundamental part of sound adaptive management processes to promote sustainable ecosystems.},

abstract = {The last two decades have witnessed unprecedented changes in beta diversity, the spatial variation in species composition, from local to global scales. However, analytical challenges have hampered empirical ecologists from quantifying the extinction and colonisation processes behind these changing beta diversity patterns. Here, we develop a novel numerical method to additively partition the temporal changes in beta diversity into components that reflect local extinctions and colonisations. By applying this method to empirical datasets, we revealed spatiotemporal community dynamics that were otherwise undetectable. In mature forests, we found that local extinctions resulted in tree communities becoming more spatially heterogeneous, while colonisations simultaneously caused them to homogenise. In coral communities, we detected non-random community disassembly and reassembly following an environmental perturbation, with a temporally varying balance between extinctions and colonisations. Partitioning the dynamic processes that underlie beta diversity can provide more mechanistic insights into the spatiotemporal organisation of biodiversity.},

@article{Levin1992a,
abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an "observer" of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging from the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

abstract = {The observed warming of the surface air temperature (SAT) over the last 50 years has not been homogenous. There are strong differences in the temperature changes both geographically and on different time frames. Here, we review the observed diurnal asymmetry in the global warming trend: the night-time temperatures have increased more rapidly than day-time temperatures. Several explanations for this asymmetric warming have been offered in the literature. These generally relate differences in the temperature trends to regionalized feedback effects, such as changes to cloud cover, precipitation or soil moisture. Here, we discuss a complementary mechanism through which the planetary boundary layer (PBL) modulates the SAT response to changes in the surface energy balance. This reciprocal relationship between boundary-layer depth and temperature response can explain a part of why the night-time has warmed more rapidly than the daytime. We used a multi-linear regression model to compare the effect of the PBL, cloud cover, precipitation and soil moisture on the SAT. From this, we demonstrate that it is the boundary-layer depth which is the strongest predictor of the strength of temperature trends in the boreal annual cycle, and in all seasons except the summer.},

abstract = {Global climate change is frequently considered a major conservation threat. The Earth's climate has already warmed by 0.5° C over the past century, and recent studies show that it is possible to detect the effects of a changing climate on ecological systems. This suggests that global change may be a current and future conservation threat. Changes in recent decades are apparent at all levels of ecological organization: population and life-history changes, shifts in geographic range, changes in species composition of communities, and changes in the structure and functioning of ecosystems. These ecological effects can be linked to recent population declines and to both local and global extinctions of species. Although it is impossible to prove that climate change is the cause of these ecological effects, these findings have important implications for conservation biology. It is no longer safe to assume that all of a species' historic range remains suitable. In drawing attention to the importance of climate change as a current threat to species, these studies emphasize the need for current conservation efforts to consider climate change in both in situ conservation and reintroduction efforts. Additional threats will emerge as climate continues to change, especially as climate interacts with other stressors such as habitat fragmentation. These studies can contribute to preparations for future challenges by providing valuable input to models and direct examples of how species respond to climate change.},

abstract = {Recent climate extremes have broken long-standing records by large margins. Such extremes unprecedented in the observational period often have substantial impacts due to a tendency to adapt to the highest intensities, and no higher, experienced during a lifetime. Here, we show models project not only more intense extremes but also events that break previous records by much larger margins. These record-shattering extremes, nearly impossible in the absence of warming, are likely to occur in the coming decades. We demonstrate that their probability of occurrence depends on warming rate, rather than global warming level, and is thus pathway-dependent. In high-emission scenarios, week-long heat extremes that break records by three or more standard deviations are two to seven times more probable in 2021–2050 and three to 21 times more probable in 2051–2080, compared to the last three decades. In 2051–2080, such events are estimated to occur about every 6–37 years somewhere in the northern midlatitudes.},

In this paper, I revisit some of the central themes of disturbance ecology and argue that the knowledge established in the field of disturbance ecology continues to be relevant to ecosystem management, even with rapid changes to disturbance regimes and changing disturbance types in local ecosystems. Disturbance ecology has been tremendously successful over the past several decades at elucidating the interactions between disturbances, biodiversity, and ecosystems, and this knowledge can be leveraged in different contexts. Primarily, management in changing and uncertain conditions should be focused primarily on the long-term persistence of that native biodiversity that has evolved within the local disturbance regime and is likely to go extinct with rapid changes to disturbance intensity, frequency, and type. Where possible, conserving aspects of natural disturbance regimes will be vital to preserving functioning ecosystems and to that native biodiversity that requires disturbance for its continued existence, though these situations may become more limited over time. Finally, scientists must actively propose management policies that incorporate knowledge of disturbance ecology. Successful policies regarding changing disturbance regimes for biodiversity will not merely be reactive, and will recognize that for natural ecosystems as for human society, not all desired outcomes are simultaneously possible.},

abstract = {Environmental conditions that vary from year to year can be strong drivers of ecological dynamics, including the composition of newly assembled communities. However, ecologists often chalk such dynamics up to “noise” in ecological experiments. Our lack of attention to such “year effects” hampers our understanding of contingencies in ecological assembly mechanisms and limits the generalizability of research findings. Here, we provide examples from published research demonstrating the importance of year effects during community assembly across study systems. We further quantify these year effects with two case studies—a grassland restoration experiment and a study of postfire conifer recruitment—finding that the effects of initiation year on community composition can dictate community as much, if not more, than the effects of experimental treatments or site. The evidence strongly suggests that year effects are pervasive and profound, and that year effects early in community assembly can drive strong and enduring divergence in community structure and function. Explicit attention to year effects in ecological research serves to illuminate basic ecological principles, allowing for better understanding of contingencies in ecology. These dynamics also have strong implications for applied ecological research, offering new insights into ecological restoration as well as future climate change.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2016. Growing populations of invasive lionfishes Pterois volitans and P. miles have had detrimental impacts on native marine fish communities and transformed many of the reef ecosystems of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. Over the last 3 decades, suitable environmental conditions and lack of natural biological controls have allowed lionfish populations to expand into areas ranging from the tropical waters of the Caribbean to the northern portions of the shelf break along the Southeast United States Continental Shelf (SEUSCS) during all months of the year. Under current climate conditions, continued expansion to waters further north or inshore from the shelf break is unlikely, given the physiological thermal tolerance of lionfish and the cooler temperatures of t hese waters. However, the geographic range of suitable environments may expand in the future with climate change. Here, we develop a conceptual model of the physical climate niche of lionfish and use projections of future ocean temperatures and salinities to explore potential lionfish habitat through the year 2100 under conditions of anthropogenic climate change. Without successful culling efforts or implementation of climate-change mitigation strategies, the spatial extent of suitable year-round lionfish habitat is expected to increase 45% on the SEUSCS during the 21 st century, covering 90% of the region. Establishment of resident populations north of Cape Hatteras is unlikely. Nevertheless, in the coming decades, the potential impact of continued lionfish invasion on the valuable marine ecosystems of the SEUSCS is cause for concern.},

abstract = {While the rise in global mean temperature over the past several decades is now widely acknowledged, the issue as to whether and to what extent temperature variability is changing continues to undergo debate. Here, variability refers to the spread of the temperature distribution. Much attention has been given to the effects that changes in mean temperature have on extremes, but these changes are accompanied by changes in variability, and it is actually the two together, in addition to all aspects of a changing climate pattern, that influence extremes. Since extremes have some of the largest impacts on society and ecology, changing temperature variability must be considered in tandem with a gradually increasing temperature mean. Previous studies of trends in temperature variability have produced conflicting results. Here we investigated ten long-term instrumental records in Europe of minimum, mean and maximum temperatures, looking for trends in seasonal, annual and decadal measures of variability (standard deviation and various quantile ranges) as well as asymmetries in the trends of extreme versus mean temperatures via quantile regression. We found consistent and accelerating mean warming during 1864-2012. In the last 40 years (1973-2012) trends for Tmax were higher than for Tmin, reaching up to 0.8 °C per 10a in spring. On the other hand, variability trends were not as uniform: significant changes occurred in opposing directions depending on the season, as well as when comparing 1864-2012 trends to those of 1973-2012. Moreover, if variability changed, then it changed asymmetrically, that is only in the part above or below the median. Consequently, trends in the extreme high and low quantiles differed. Regional differences indicated that in winter, high-alpine stations had increasing variability trends for Tmax especially at the upper tail compared to no changes or decreasing variability at low altitude stations. In contrast, summer variability increased at all stations studied.},

In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category-subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to-individual ratios). Rarefaction methods - both sample-based and individual-based -allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

abstract = {Southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma) are a coastal flatfish species that supports recreational and commercial fisheries but are currently experiencing range-wide declines. To quantify the range-wide declines and investigate the role of climate in these declines, fishery-independent sampling data of age-0 flounder were obtained from 34 estuaries representing four states in the Gulf of Mexico (TX, LA, AL, and FL) and three states in the Southeastern United States Atlantic Ocean (FL, SC, and NC) spanning from 1976 to 2019. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to estimate age-0 recruitment trends. Spatial and temporal synchrony analyses were then conducted using annual GAM-predicted values to determine if trends were similar between estuaries in close proximity, and if declines occurred at the same time. Because the species is dependent on physical transport (i.e., winds and tides) for recruitment, hourly wind speed, wind direction, water temperature, and air temperature were obtained for estuaries with non-zero sampling totals and long-term data sets. Only six estuaries showed significant relationships between age-0 flounder indices and growing degree days. However, all estuaries with wind data showed significant relationships between age-0 flounder indices and hourly summed wind speed. Southern flounder also have environmental sex determination, meaning warming estuaries could also account for population changes and declines. We document that water temperatures in the same space and time where southern flounder sexually determine are warmer now than even a decade ago, which could masculinize populations and substantially change population demographics. These results illustrate the vulnerability of estuarine finfish populations to climate change and increased climate variability. Understanding how climate acts on southern flounder biology may help managers respond to and prevent fishery collapses.},

We describe the consumption of the red lionfish and the response behavior of the predator. Understanding predation pressures on red lionfish in the western Atlantic Ocean is of great significance given the rapid growth of this invasive species and its potential effects on populations of coral reef fish. This important problem is exacerbated by the fact that top predators have largely been overfished in the western Atlantic, thus removing potential predators for this invasive species. Our observation suggests that the spotted moray and, by extrapolation, other morays might represent a naturally occurring top-down control agent of invasive red lionfish. Muraenids in general could play a critical role as bio-control forces because moray eel populations have been largely spared the effects of overfishing.},

In order to determine the causative mutations in three affected sibs from a consanguineous Sudanese family with EOPD, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was performed and revealed that the patients were homozygous for a deletion of PINK1 exons 4 to 8. Breakpoint analysis revealed a complex rearrangement combining a large deletion and the insertion of a sequence duplicated from the DDOST gene intron 2, located near the PINK1 gene. As breakpoint sequences displayed only three base pairs of homology, this rearrangement may result from Fork Stalling and Template Switching mechanism.

abstract = {Marine fishes and invertebrates respond to ocean warming through distribution shifts, generally to higher latitudes and deeper waters. Consequently, fisheries should be affected by 'tropicalization' of catch (increasing dominance of warm-water species). However, a signature of such climate-change effects on global fisheries catch has so far not been detected. Here we report such an index, the mean temperature of the catch (MTC), that is calculated from the average inferred temperature preference of exploited species weighted by their annual catch. Our results show that, after accounting for the effects of fishing and large-scale oceanographic variability, global MTC increased at a rate of 0.19 degrees Celsius per decade between 1970 and 2006, and non-tropical MTC increased at a rate of 0.23 degrees Celsius per decade. In tropical areas, MTC increased initially because of the reduction in the proportion of subtropical species catches, but subsequently stabilized as scope for further tropicalization of communities became limited. Changes in MTC in 52 large marine ecosystems, covering the majority of the world's coastal and shelf areas, are significantly and positively related to regional changes in sea surface temperature. This study shows that ocean warming has already affected global fisheries in the past four decades, highlighting the immediate need to develop adaptation plans to minimize the effect of such warming on the economy and food security of coastal communities, particularly in tropical regions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Biogeographical shifts are a ubiquitous global response to climate change. However, observed shifts across taxa and geographical locations are highly variable and only partially attributable to climatic conditions. Such variable outcomes result from the interaction between local climatic changes and other abiotic and biotic factors operating across species ranges. Among them, external directional forces such as ocean and air currents influence the dispersal of nearly all marine and many terrestrial organisms. Here, using a global meta-dataset of observed range shifts of marine species, we show that incorporating directional agreement between flow and climate significantly increases the proportion of explained variance. We propose a simple metric that measures the degrees of directional agreement of ocean (or air) currents with thermal gradients and considers the effects of directional forces in predictions of climate-driven range shifts. Ocean flows are found to both facilitate and hinder shifts depending on their directional agreement with spatial gradients of temperature. Further, effects are shaped by the locations of shifts in the range (trailing, leading or centroid) and taxonomic identity of species. These results support the global effects of climatic changes on distribution shifts and stress the importance of framing climate expectations in reference to other non-climatic interacting factors.},

abstract = {Adults of Chthalllaills stellatus occur In the marine intertidal in a zone above that of another barnacle, Balallus balallo{\pounds}des. Young Chthamalus settle in the Balanus zone but evidently seldom survive, since few adults are found there. The survival of Chthall/aills which had settled at various levels in the Balanus zone was followed for a year by successive censuses of mapped individuals. Some Chthalllalus were kept free of contact with Balallus. These survived very well at all intertidal le\'els, indicating that increased time of submergence was not the factor responsible for elimination of Chthall/alus at low shore levels. Comparison of the survival of unprotected populations with others. protected by enclosure in cages from predation by the snail, Thais lapillus. shO\ved that Thais was not greatly affecting the survival of Chthall/alus. Comparison of the survival of undisturbed populations of Clzthall/alus with those kept free of contact with Balallus indicated that Balallus could cause great mortality of Chthall/alus. Balanus settled in greater population densities and grew faster than Chthalllalus. Direct observations at each census showed that Balanus smothered, undercut, or crushed the Chtlzamalus; the greatest mortality of Chthamalus occurred during the seasons of most rapid growth of Balanus. Even older Chthal11alus transplanted to low levels were killed by Balanus in this way. Predation by Thais tended to decrease the severity of this interspecific competition. Survivors of Chtha11lalus after a year of crowding hy Balanlts were smaller than uncrowded ones. Since smaller barnacles produce fewer offspring, competition tended to reduce reproductive efficiency in addition to increasing mortality. :\Iortality as a result of intraspecies competition for space between individuals of Chthamalus was only rarely observed. The evidence of this and other studies indicates that the lower limit of distribution of intertidal organisms is mainly determined by the action of biotic factors such as competition for space or predation. The upper limit is probably more{\textperiodcentered} often set hy physical factors.},

abstract = {Fear of the human ‘super predator' has been demonstrated to so alter the feeding behavior of large carnivores as to cause trophic cascades. It has yet to be experimentally tested if fear of humans has comparably large effects on the feeding behavior of large herbivores. We conducted a predator playback experiment exposing white-tailed deer to the vocalizations of humans, extant or locally extirpated non-human predators (coyotes, cougars, dogs, wolves), or non-predator controls (birds), at supplemental food patches to measure the relative impacts on deer feeding behavior. Deer were more than twice as likely to flee upon hearing humans than other predators, and hearing humans was matched only by hearing wolves in reducing overall feeding time gaged by visits to the food patch in the following hour. Combined with previous, site-specific research linking deer fecundity to predator abundance, this study reveals that fear of humans has the potential to induce a larger effect on ungulate reproduction than has ever been reported. By demonstrating that deer most fear the human ‘super predator', our results point to the fear humans induce in large ungulates having population- and community-level impacts comparable to those caused by the fear humans induce in large carnivores.},

abstract = {The increasing frequency of very high summertime temperatures has motivated growing interest in the processes determining the probability distribution of surface temperature over land. Here, we show that on monthly time scales, temperature anomalies can be modeled as linear responses to fluctuations in shortwave radiation and precipitation. Our model contains only three adjustable parameters, and, surprisingly, these can be taken as constant across the globe, notwithstanding large spatial variability in topography, vegetation, and hydrological processes. Using observations of shortwave radiation and precipitation from 2000 to 2017, the model accurately reproduces the observed pattern of temperature variance throughout the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. In addition, the variance in latent heat flux estimated by the model agrees well with the few long-term records that are available in the central United States. As an application of the model, we investigate the changes in the variance of monthly averaged surface temperature that might be expected due to anthropogenic climate change. We find that a climatic warming of 48C causes a 10% increase in temperature variance in parts of North America.},

abstract = {Migration is ubiquitous and can strongly shape food webs and ecosystems. Less familiar, however, is that the majority of life cycle, seasonal and diel migrations in nature are partial migrations: only a fraction of the population migrates while the other individuals remain in their resident ecosystem. Here, we demonstrate different impacts of partial migration rendering it fundamental to our understanding of the significance of migration for food web and ecosystem dynamics. First, partial migration affects the spatiotemporal distribution of individuals and the food web and ecosystem-level processes they drive differently than expected under full migration. Second, whether an individual migrates or not is regularly correlated with morphological, physiological, and/or behavioural traits that shape its food-web and ecosystem-level impacts. Third, food web and ecosystem dynamics can drive the fraction of the population migrating, enabling the potential for feedbacks between the causes and consequences of migration within and across ecosystems. These impacts, individually and in combination, can yield unintuitive effects of migration and drive the dynamics, diversity and functions of ecosystems. By presenting the first full integration of partial migration and trophic (meta-)community and (meta-)ecosystem ecology, we provide a roadmap for studying how migration affects and is affected by ecosystem dynamics in a changing world.},

As such, it has a great potential to generalize and synthesize our understanding of many ecological problems. Here, we give an overview of how a metacommunity perspective can provide useful insights for conservation biology, which aims to understand and mitigate the effects of anthropogenic drivers that decrease population sizes, increase extinction probabilities, and threaten biodiversity. We review four general metacommunity processes-environmental filtering, biotic interactions, dispersal, and ecological drift-and discuss how key anthropogenic drivers (e.g., habitat loss and fragmentation, and nonnative species) can alter these processes. We next describe how the patterns of interest in metacommunities (abundance, occupancy, and diversity) map onto issues at the heart of conservation biology, and describe cases where conservation biology benefits by taking a scale-explicit metacommunity perspective. We conclude with some ways forward for including metacommunity perspectives into ideas of ecosystem functioning and services, as well as approaches to habitat management, preservation, and restoration.},

abstract = {Although salt marsh tidal creeks are among the shallow coastal and estuarine habitats important to juvenile fish, little is known about the temporal patterns of their use by flatfish in the southeastern USA. We used a 12-year monitoring study to examine seasonal and interannual variation in juvenile flatfish occupation of a salt marsh tidal creek. Fishes were collected monthly with a 1-m beam trawl during the middle of ebbing tide near Savannah, GA. Flatfishes were the most consistently collected and numerous species obtained; we rarely obtained other fish in high number except for an occasional recruitment pulse of sciaenids. The six flatfish species collected were blackcheek tonguefish Symphurus plagiusa, bay whiff Citharichthys spilopterus, fringed flounder Etropus crossotus, summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus, southern flounder Paralichthys lethostigma, and ocellated flounder Ancylopsetta quadrocellata. Bay whiff was the only species consistently collected as new recruits (< 20 mm TL), accounting for 83% of all recruits obtained in the study. Flatfish were collected year-round, with bay whiff numerically dominating winter and spring assemblages and blackcheek tonguefish dominant in summer, leading to differences in seasonal assemblages. Flatfish assemblage composition did not exhibit a consistent trend across years but was related to temperature variation. For instance, flatfish assemblages collected in springs that followed unusually cold winters differed from those that followed mild winters, contributing to interannual variation in habitat use. Bay whiff growth was positively related to temperature, but was not related to the densities of conspecifics or total flatfish. Estuarine tidal creeks provide important settlement and nursery habitat for flatfish that partition habitat use temporally via seasonal and interannual variation, and these fishes can consistently dominate the composition of ichthyofaunal benthic recruits.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The global decline of corals has created an urgent need for effective, science-based methods to augment coral populations and restore important ecosystem functions. To meet this challenge, the field of coral restoration has rapidly evolved over the past decade. However, despite widespread efforts to outplant corals and monitor survivorship, there is a shortage of information on the effects of coral restoration on reef communities or important ecosystem functions. To fill this knowledge gap, we examined the effects of restoration on three major criteria: diversity, community structure, and ecological processes. We conducted surveys of four restored sites in the Florida Keys ranging in restoration effort (500–2,300 corals outplanted) paired with surveys of nearby, unmanipulated control sites. Coral restoration successfully enhanced coral populations, increasing coral cover 4-fold, but manifested in limited differences in coral and fish communities. Some restored sites had higher abundance of herbivorous fish, rates of herbivory, or more juvenile-sized corals, but these effects were limited to individual reefs. Damselfish were consistently more abundant at restored compared to control sites. Despite augmenting target coral populations, 3 years of coral restoration has not facilitated many of the positive feedbacks that help reinforce coral success. In a time of increasingly frequent disturbances, it is urgent we hasten the speed at which reefs recover important ecological processes, such as herbivory and nutrient cycling, that make reefs more resistant and resilient if we are to achieve long-term restoration success.},

abstract = {Often described as oligotrophic, the west Florida continental shelf supports abundant fisheries, experiences blooms of the harmful algae, Karenia brevis and exhibits subsurface chlorophyll maxima evident in shipboard and glider surveys. Renewal of inorganic nutrients by the upwelling of deeper ocean water onto the shelf may account for this, but what are the origins and pathways by which such new water may broach the shelf break and advance toward the shoreline? We address these questions via numerical model simulations of pseudo-Lagrangian, isopycnic water parcel trajectories. Focus is on 2010, when the west Florida shelf was subjected to an anomalously protracted period of upwelling caused by Gulf of Mexico Loop Current interactions with the shelf slope. Origins and pathways are determined by integrating trajectories over successive 45 day intervals, beginning from different locations along the shelf break and at various locations and depths along the shelf slope. Waters upwelling across the shelf break are found to originate from relatively shallow depths along the shelf slope. Even for the anomalous 2010 year, much of this upwelling occurs from about 150 m and above, although waters may broach the shelf break from 300 m depth, particularly in the Florida Panhandle. Such inter-annual renewal of west Florida shelf waters appears to have profound effects on west Florida shelf ecology. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. },

Contrary to our expectations, we did not detect systematic loss of $\alpha$ diversity. However, community composition changed systematically through time, in excess of predictions from null models. Heterogeneous rates of environmental change, species range shifts associated with climate change, and biotic homogenization may explain the different patterns of temporal $\alpha$ and $\beta$ diversity.

abstract = {–The goal of our study was to understand the spatial and tempo­ ral variation in spawning and settle­ ment of gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus) along the West Florida shelf (WFS). Juvenile gray snapper were collected over two consecutive years from sea­ grass meadows with a benthic scrape and otter trawl. Spawning, settlement, and growth patterns were compared across three sampling regions (Pan­ handle, Big bend, and Southwest) by using otolith microstructure. Histology of adult gonads was also used for an independent estimate of spawning time. Daily growth increments were visible in the lapilli of snapper 11–150 mm standard length; ages ranged from 38 to 229 days and estimated average plank­ tonic larval duration was 25 days. Esti­ mated growth rates ranged from 0.60 to 1.02 mm/d and did not differ among the three sampling regions, but did differ across sampling years.

abstract = {Alaska is at the northern end of an apparent latitudinal trend of decreasing coastal marine introductions on the West Coast of North America. Historical propagule supply may have played a role in forming this trend, but few studies have evaluated propagule supply to northern latitudes. Here, we examined the role of small boat traffic as a mechanism of long-distance spread for nonindigenous species (NIS) into coastal Alaska. We used a combination of public records, marina surveys, and boater interviews to characterize vessel traffic patterns and boater behaviors. In-water SCUBA sampling of recently arrived transient boats provided data on extent, richness, composition, and biogeography of biofouling incursions to Alaska from outside of the state. We documented a striking seasonality and directionality of vessel traffic, and most vessels were on voyages of >900 km. Most transient vessels sampled had few organisms, although one third had >100 organisms on submerged surfaces. Several NIS were recorded, including two that are not known to be established in Alaska (Watersipora subtorquata and Amphibalanus improvisus). The seasonal northward pulse of vessels and their cumulative biofouling species represent an important incursion mechanism for species yet to establish at the northern edge of a marine bioinvasion front in the northeastern Pacific. The low numbers of NIS sampled in this study coincide with the low number of marine NIS known from Alaska, which suggests that an opportunity remains to promote awareness and management of the vector to limit NIS influx to the region. This may be particularly relevant for future scenarios of increased vessel traffic and ocean warming, which are likely to interact to increase establishment success of invaders from the south.},

abstract = {Global warming could threaten over 400 species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) worldwide, including all species of sea turtle. During embryonic development, rising temperatures might lead to the overproduction of one sex and, in turn, could bias populations' sex ratios to an extent that threatens their persistence. If climate change predictions are correct, and biased sex ratios reduce population viability, species with TSD may go rapidly extinct unless adaptive mechanisms, whether behavioural, physiological or molecular, exist to buffer these temperature-driven effects. Here, we summarize the discovery of the TSD phenomenon and its still elusive evolutionary significance. We then review the molecular pathways underpinning TSD in model species, along with the hormonal mechanisms that interact with temperatures to determine an individual's sex. To illustrate evolutionary mechanisms that can affect sex determination, we focus on sea turtle biology, discussing both the adaptive potential of this threatened TSD taxon, and the risks associated with conservation mismanagement.},
